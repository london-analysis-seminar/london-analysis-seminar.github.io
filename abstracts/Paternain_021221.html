<em> The transport Oka-Grauert principle for simple surfaces </em><br />
<br />
Abstract: I will explain how to show the existence of matrix
holomorphic integrating factors on simple surfaces
and how this gives rise to a full description of the range of the
non-Abelian X-ray transform.
The main result can be recast as the absence of non-trivial
holomorphic vector bundles over the twistor space of a simple surface
thus providing a transport version of the classical Oka-Grauert
principle in complex geometry.
This is joint work with Jan Bohr.
