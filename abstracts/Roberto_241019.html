<em>Log Hessian estimates and the Talagrand Conjecture</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
Motivated by Talagrand's conjecture on the regularization effect of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semi-group, we investigate lower bounds on the log Hessian of a family of diffusion semi-group (essentially perturbation of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semi-group). We will also investigate similar questions for the (discrete) M/M/infinity queuing process on the integers. Joint work with N. Gozlan, X. M Li, M. Madiman and P. M. Samson.
