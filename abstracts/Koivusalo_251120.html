Dynamical subsets in iterated function systems.
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

Questions about recurrence are fundamental to the study of dynamical systems.
The classical shrinking target problem concerns the set of points returning
infinitely often to a target of fixed position but shrinking size. In this talk
I will discuss what is known about the sizes of various dynamical subsets in the
context of iterated function systems (IFSs), finishing with a brand new result
on shrinking targets. This new result completely resolves the problem of finding
the Hausdorff dimension of the shrinking target set in generic affine IFSs for
dynamical targets. In contrast to past works on the topic, the new result
requires no multiplicativity condition on the affine IFS.
