<em>  A continuous family of conserved energies for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
The Gross-Pitaevskii equation is the defocusing cubic nonlinear 
Schr&ouml;dinger equation with the boundary conditions |u(t,x)| -> 1
at infinity.  A difficulty in the study of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation 
is that the state space is nonlinear. In joint work with Xian Liao we 
study the equation in one space dimension, equip it with a new metric, 
and construct a continuous family of conserved energies.
