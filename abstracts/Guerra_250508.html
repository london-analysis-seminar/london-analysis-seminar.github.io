<em>
Harmonic maps and the vectorial obstacle problem
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

I will discuss some recent results obtained in collaboration with A. Figalli, S.
Kim and H. Shahgholian. We consider minimizers of the Dirichlet energy among
maps constrained to take values outside a smooth domain O in &reals;<sup>m</sup>. These
minimizers can be thought of as harmonic maps into the manifold-with-boundary
given by the complement of O, while O acts as an obstacle. I will discuss
results concerning the regularity of the minimizers, the location of their
singularities, and the structure of the free boundary.
