<em>Pointwise ergodic theorems for bilinear polynomial averages</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
We shall discuss the proof of pointwise almost everywhere convergence for the non-conventional
(in the sense of Furstenberg) bilinear polynomial ergodic averages. This is my recent work with
Ben Krause and Terry Tao. I will also talk about recent progress in this area.
