<em> Analytic one-frequency cocycles </em><br />

Abstract: We consider analytic cocycles of d \times d matrices.
We prove joint continuity (depending on frequency and the analytic
function of d \times d matrices) of all Lyapunov exponents at irrational
frequencies. The proof is conceptually new, even for the $d=2$ case. This
leads to quantization of acceleration and other strong consequences.
Based on joint work with A. Avila and C. Sadel.
