Global stability of Kaluza-Klein spacetimes  </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

 Spacetimes formed from the cartesian product of Minkowski space and a flat torus play an important role as toy models for theories of supergravity and string theory. In this talk I will discuss an upcoming work with Huneau and Stingo showing the nonlinear stability of such a Kaluza-Klein spacetime. The result is also connected to a claim of Witten.
