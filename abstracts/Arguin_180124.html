<em> Large Values of the Riemann Zeta Function: A Probabilistic Journey </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

The interplay between probability theory and analytic number theory has a rich
history of producing deep results and conjectures. Important instances are the
works of Erd&odblac;s, Kac, Selberg, Montgomery, Soundararajan and Granville, to name a
few. This talk will review recent results in this spirit where the insights of
probability have led to a better understanding of large values of the Riemann
zeta function on the critical line. This is based in part on joint works with
Emma Bailey, and with Paul Bourgade &amp; Maksym Radziwi&lstrok;&lstrok;.
