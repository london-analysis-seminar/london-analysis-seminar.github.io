<em>  Direct and inverse scattering  for point scatterers
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>

To test algorithms for solving direct and inverse scattering problems it is very important to have exactly solvable models. However, unlike the one-dimensional case, it is very difficult to produce such exactly solvable models in the multidimensional case.
In this talk, we consider a model of point scatterers, which goes back to the works of
Bethe and Peierls (1935), Fermi (1936), Zel'dovich (1960), Berezin and Faddeev (1961),
and which is exactly solvable. We present a short review of old and recent results in this domain.
<br>
This talk is based, in particular, on joint works with P.G. Grinevich and A.D. Agaltsov.
