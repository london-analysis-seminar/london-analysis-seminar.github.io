<em> Pointwise convergence of scattering data. </em><br />
<br />
Abstract: We apply complex analytic tools to study convergence
of the scattering matrix of a real Dirac system on the half-line.
Equivalently, we study a version of Carleson's theorem on pointwise convergence
in the case of non-linear Fourier transform.
