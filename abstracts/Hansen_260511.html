The Solvability Complexity Index and Approximations of Spectra of 
Operators

Abstract: 
<br>
In this talk we will discuss the following long standing and 
fundamental problem: Given an operator on a separable Hilbert space (with 
an orthonormal basis), can one compute/construct its spectrum from its 
matrix elements. As we want such a construction to be useful in application 
(i.e. implementable on a computer), we restrict ourselves to only allowing 
the use of arithmetic operations and radicals of the matrix elements and 
taking limits. We will give an affirmative answer to the question, and also 
introduce a classification tool for the complexity of different 
computational spectral problems, namely, the Solvability Complexity Index.
