<em> Particle trajectories beneath irrotational travelling water waves </em><br />
<br />
Abstract: We describe the pattern of the particle trajectories beneath a travelling wave moving at the surface of water in irrotational flow and with a flat bed, with no underlying current, both in the setting of periodic waves (Stokes waves) and in the setting of solitary waves.
