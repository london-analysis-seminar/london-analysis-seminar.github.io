<em>  Construction of oscillatory singular homogenuous space times </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
The  vacuum Einstein equations for Bianchi space times (that is space times  that can be foliated into three dimensional space like slices that are  all homogenuous spaces) reduce to a system of ordinary differential  equations. The conjectures of Belinskii, Khalatnikov and Lifshitz predict that for almost all initial data the solutions of  these differential equation behave like trajectories of a billiard in a  Farey triangle in the hyperbolic plane, that is, a triangle whose three  vertices are ideal points. In joint work with M.Reiterer and E.Trubowitz we show that, for a set of initial data that  has positive measure, this is indeed the case.   
We use ideas inspired by scattering theory for approximations of  the system. The fact that billiard in a Farey triangle is chaotic leads  us to small divisor problems similiar to those of KAM theory in  Hamiltonian dynamics.
