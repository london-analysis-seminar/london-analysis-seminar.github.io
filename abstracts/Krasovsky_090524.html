<em>Strong and weak confinement in the Freud ensemble of random matrices  </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

We discuss the Freud ensemble of random matrices (the unitary ensemble
associated with the Freud orthogonal polynomials with weight
exp(-|x|<sup>&beta;</sup>),
&beta;&gt;0).
At the point x=0, a curious transition takes place when &beta; crosses the value
1. We obtain asymptotic formulas for the probability of a large gap around x=0
in the local scaling regime and present the 2 distinct cases for &beta;&lt;1 and
&beta;&gt;1.

This is a joint work with
Tom Claeys and Olexander Minakov.
