<em>  Modifications of functions, Fourier coefficients and greedy algorithms
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
In this talk some new results in nonlinear approximation will be presented - namely, on the convergence of greedy algorithms, 
and the behaviour of Fourier coefficients with respect to the
 classical systems (trigonometric, Walsh, Haar, Shauder, Franklin, Vilenkin etc.) from the viewpoint 
of the well-known classical theorems on "correction" of functions.
