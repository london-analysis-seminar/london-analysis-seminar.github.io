<em>  Geometric Whitney problem
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
the approximation Whitney problem concerns with finding a finitely smooth function in a domain of Euclidian space 
which approximates a given one defined in a compact inside this domain (treat the latter as measurements). 
In this talk we discuss the geometric version of this problem in terms of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between metric spaaces. 
This is a joint result with Ch. Fefferman (USA), S. Ivanov (Russia), M. Lassas (Finland) and H. Narayanan (USA).
