<em> Nodal length fluctuations for arithmetic random waves </em><br />
<br />
Abstract: Using the spectral multiplicities of the standard torus, we endow the
Laplace eigenspaces with Gaussian probability measures. This induces a
notion of random Gaussian Laplace eigenfunctions on the torus
(“arithmetic random waves”). We study the distribution of the nodal
length of random eigenfunctions for large eigenvalues, and our primary
result is that the asymptotics for the variance is non-universal, and
is intimately related to the arithmetic of lattice points lying on a
circle with radius corresponding to the energy. This work is joint
with Manjunath Krishnapur and Par Kurlberg.
