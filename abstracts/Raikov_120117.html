<em>  Local Eigenvalue Asymptotics of the Perturbed Krein Laplacian 
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
I will consider the Krein Laplacian on a regular bounded domain, perturbed by a real-valued multiplier V vanishing on the boundary. 
Assuming that V has a definite sign, I will discuss the asymptotics of the eigenvalue sequence which converges to the origin. 
In particular, I will show that the effective Hamiltonian that governs the main asymptotic term of this sequence, 
is the harmonic Toeplitz operator with symbol V, unitarily equivalent to a pseudodifferential operator on the boundary. 

This is a joint work with Vincent Bruneau (Bordeaux, France).
