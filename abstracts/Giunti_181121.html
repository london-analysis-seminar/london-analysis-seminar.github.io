<em>  Quantitative homogenization for interacting particle systems</em><br />
<br />
Abstract: 
We are interested in the bulk diffusion matrix A associated to a class of interacting particle systems in R^d. The models that we consider are reversible with respect to the Poisson measures and are of non-gradient type. Relying on the recent progress in quantitative stochastic homogenization for elliptic PDEs, we prove that finite-volume approximations of A converge at an algebraic rate. Furthermore, we show that A is smooth in the density of particles and characterize its derivatives.
