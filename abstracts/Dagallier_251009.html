<em>
The Polchinski dynamics: an introduction
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

I will introduce the Polchinski dynamics (or flow), a general framework to study
asymptotic properties of statistical mechanics and field theory models, inspired
by renormalisation group ideas.
The Polchinski dynamics has appeared recently under different names, such as
stochastic localisation, and in very different contexts (Markov chain mixing,
optimal transport, functional inequalities...) Here I will motivate its
construction from a physics point of view and mention a few applications. In
particular, I will explain how the Polchinski flow can be used to generalise
Bakry and Emery's &Gamma;<sub>2</sub> calculus to obtain functional inequalities
(e.g. Poincar&eacute;,
log-Sobolev) in physics models which are typically high-dimensional and
non-convex. The talk is based on a review paper with Roland Bauerschmidt and
Thierry Bodineau, accessible <a
