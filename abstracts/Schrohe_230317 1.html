<em>  Elliptic Operators Associated with Groups of Quantized Canonical Transformations
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
Given a Lie group G of quantized canonical transformations acting on the space L^2(M) over a closed manifold M, we define an algebra of
so-called G-operators on L^2(M). We show that to G-operators we
can associate symbols in appropriate crossed products with G,
introduce a notion of ellipticity and prove the Fredholm property for
elliptic elements.
This framework encompasses many known elliptic theories, for instance,
shift operators associated with group actions on M, transversal
elliptic theory, transversally elliptic pseudodifferential operators on
foliations, and Fourier integral operators associated with coisotropic
submanifolds.
