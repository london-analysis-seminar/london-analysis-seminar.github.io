Title: Pseudo-differential operators and Feller-Markov processes on compact groups.

<br><br>

Abstract: <br>

The associated semigroup, generator and resolvent of a Feller-
Markov process on
$\R^{n}$ may all be represented as pseudo-differential operators, and
the converse problem
of constructing a process from a given symbol has been intensely studied
by Niels Jacob and
his group. In recent years Michael Ruzhansky and Ville Turunen have
built a global theory of
pseudo-differential operators on compact Lie groups using Peter-Weyl
theory. In this talk I'll
describe how the Ruzhansky-Turunen approach can be applied to associate
pseudo-
diiferential operators to Feller-Markov processes on compact groups. A
particularly
interesting class of processes which appear in statistical applications
are a class of central
Levy processes having laws whose Fourier transforms are induced from the
real line by
means of the Casimir spectrum. In this case the pseudo-differential
operator approach yields
an easy proof of Sobolev regularity for the generator.
