Abstract: <br><br>

The spectral gap of a hyperbolic surface is its smallest non-zero eigenvalue λ1;
it is large if and only if the surface is well-connected (hard to cut) and has
good dynamical properties (the geodesic flow mixes very fast). In the
large-genus limit, the spectral gap cannot be much larger than 1/4, the bottom
of the spectrum of the hyperbolic plane. I will present results obtained in an
ongoing collaboration with Nalini Anantharaman, in which we aim to prove that,
for any &epsilon;>0, typically, &lambda;<sub>1</sub> > 1/4 - &epsilon;. In order to do so, we study random
hyperbolic surfaces, sampled according to the Weil-Petersson model. I will
explain how the Selberg trace formula allows us to transform the spectral gap
question into a random geometry question. I will then present new results
allowing to study the geometry of random surfaces, and in particular to deal
with non-simple closed geodesics.
