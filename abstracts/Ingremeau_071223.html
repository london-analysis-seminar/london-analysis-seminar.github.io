<em> Quantum chaos under generic perturbations </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

Quantum chaos is the study of Laplace eigenfunctions (or more generally,
of the propagation of waves) in geometries where the classical dynamics
is chaotic.
After presenting several open problems in quantum chaos, I will explain
how one can obtain new results when a small (pseudodifferential) random
perturbation is added to the Laplacian.
Specifically, I will present two kinds of results: one comparing the
evolution of Lagrangian states with Gaussian fields, in the spirit of
Berry’s random wave model; the other, giving improved L<sup>&#8734;</sup> bounds on
the eigenfunctions. This is joint work with Martin Vogel.
