<em>   Random Matrices, the Normal Matrix Model, and Universality </em><br />
<br />
Abstract:
The talk will present a broad overview of random matrix theory, settling in on the Normal Matrix Model, which is an ensemble of random matrices with eigenvalues accumulating on domains in the complex plane (often called droplets).  New results for the Normal Matrix Model will be presented at the end, and merriment will be had through a surprising connection to some classical functions of yore.  The new results are joint work with Ferenc Balogh, Marco Bertola, and Seung Yeop Lee.
