<em> 
Fractional Laplacians: propagation, delocalisation, and evolution
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

In this talk, we will survey some results around this question, and connect such
eigenstate concentration to scars and chaos in quantum systems. We then discuss
some new propagation and tunnelling results for fractional Laplacians, with
their application in obtaining decay estimates for linearised gravity and
capillary water waves. Those are joint works with Perry Kleinhenz (Illinois
State), and with Jian Wang (IH&Eacute;S).
