Abstract: 
In the last years there has been  an increasing interest to
the study of the rates of decay of bounded C_0-semigroups
motivated by concrete applications to PDE's,
e.g. to the study of energy decay for damped
wave equations. We intend to review recent results
and technique pertaining to decay of bounded C0-
semigroups on Banach spaces obtained by Batty &
Duyckaerts (2008) and Borichev & Tomilov (2010)
and to discuss several notorious open problems
in this domain.
