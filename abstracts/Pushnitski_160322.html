<em> The spectra of some arithmetical matrices</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
I will discuss the spectral theory of a family of infinite number-theoretic matrices, whose (n,m)'th entry involves the least common multiple of n and m, denoted LCM(n,m). The simplest example of such matrix is {1/LCM(n,m)}, where n,m range over natural numbers. It turns out that an explicit formula for the asymptotics of eigenvalues of this matrix can be given. This is recent joint work with Titus Hilberdink (Reading).
