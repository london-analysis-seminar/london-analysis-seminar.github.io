<em> Moutard type transformations for generalized analytic functions and for the conductivity equation </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
The transformations of the Darboux-Moutard type go back to publications [ Moutard, 1878], [Darboux 1882].
Recently, we have constructed and studied Moutard type transformations for generalized analytic functions
(that is for the Carleman system or Bers-Vekua system) and further for the conductivity equation.
This talk is based, in particular, on works  [Grinevich, Novikov, 2016, 2019], [ Novikov, Taimanov, 2016, 2018].
