Ergodic Hankel Operators
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

I will start the talk by introducing Hankel operators on the half-line and discussing the intriguing spectral analogy with one-dimensional Schroedinger operators. Guided by this analogy, Leonid Pastur and I have introduced the class of Ergodic Hankel Operators. I will describe this class and outline our first steps in developing its spectral theory. In particular, I will focus on the definition and basic properties of the integrated density of states measure.
