<em> Asymptotics of block Toeplitz determinants with piecewise continuous
    symbols  </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

I discuss the asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz determinants with Fisher-Hartwig singularities with focus on recent joint work with Estelle Basor and Torsten Ehrhardt which deals with matrix-valued symbols that are piecewise continuous and arise in the study of entanglement
