<em>  Stability of the FLRW Solutions to the Dust-Einstein System with a Positive Cosmological Constant </em><br />
<br />
Abstract: The dust-Einstein system models the evolution of a spacetime containing a pressureless fluid, i.e. dust.
We will show nonlinear stability of the well-known Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) family of solutions to the dust-Einstein system with positive cosmological constant.  FLRW solutions represent initially a quiet fluid evolving in a spacetime undergoing accelerated expansion. 

We work in a harmonic-type coordinate system, inspired by prior works of Rodnianski and Speck on Euler-Einstein system, and Ringstroem's work on the Einstein-scalar-field system.  The main new mathematical difficulty is the additional loss of one degree of differentiability of the dust matter. To deal with this degeneracy, we commute the equations with a well-chosen differential operator and derive a family of elliptic estimates to complement the high-order energy estimates. This is joint work with Jared Speck.
