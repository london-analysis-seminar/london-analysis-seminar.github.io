Singularities in mean curvature flow
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

Mean curvature flow moves a hypersurface in Euclidean space with velocity equal
to its mean curvature vector. This evolution is described by a nonlinear weakly
parabolic system. Variationally, it is a formal gradient flow for the volume
functional. Solutions to mean curvature flow exhibit a huge variety of different
kinds of singularities. For solutions which move monotonically (have nowhere
vanishing mean curvature), however, these singularities exhibit enough structure
so that they might eventually be completely classified. We will discuss the now
essentially complete picture for surfaces in R<sup>3</sup> developed over the last 40
years, and then explore the dramatically more complicated setting of
3-dimensional hypersurfaces in R<sup>4</sup>.
