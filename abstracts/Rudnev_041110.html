Title: A Szemeredi-Trotter/Beck type theorem in prime fields.

<br><br>

Abstract: <br>

Abstract: In the early 1980s J. Beck proved a theorem that for any 
set P of N points in the Euclidean plane, at least one of the two 
following claims must hold, for some absolute c: (i) cN of the 
points lie on the same straight line or (ii) there are cN^2 
distinct  straight lines determined by pairs of points. A sum-
product theorem by Bourgain/Katz/Tao/Konyagin (early 2000s) implied 
that in a plane over a prime finite field F_p the same type of 
result must hold, provided that N is by order of magnitude smaller 
than the cardinality of the plane itself (in the latter case there 
will be just N lines determined by all pairs of the N points). But 
if P is a cartesian product AxA, with say |P|< p, then P determines 
at least |P|^{1+ \epsilon} lines, for some \epsilon >0. However, no 
quantitative lower bound for \epsilon was known.

Presented in this talk is a quantitative version of the theorem (a 
joint work with H. Helfgott) : using the more recent state-of-the-
art sum-product type technique we can prove that  \epsilon > 1/267; 
also discussed are some consequences and connections. It is not 
clear what the best possible bound here shall be.
