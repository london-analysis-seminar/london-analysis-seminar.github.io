Localization for the Random Displacement Model

Abstract: 
<br>
The Random Displacement Model (RDM) describes the motion of an electron in a spatially
disordered medium. This is in contrast to the Anderson model where the disorder is in the coupling
constants. A proof of localization for the RDM near the edge of the deterministic spectrum  will be outlined. 
Localization is meant in both senses, pure point spectrum with exponentially decaying eigenfunctions as well 
as dynamical localization. The proof relies on a well established multi-scale analysis and the main problem is 
to verify the necessary ingredients, such as a Lifshitz tail estimate and a Wegner estimate.
