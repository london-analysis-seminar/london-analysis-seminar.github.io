<em> Existence of dynamical black holes </em><br />
<br />
Abstract: After an introduction to the Black Hole Stability Problem, I
will present a construction of a large class of dynamical vacuum
spacetimes which asymptote in time to a fixed Schwarzschild-, or more
generally, Kerr-spacetime. The solutions are obtained in the context of
a scattering problem with data prescribed on the event horizon and at
null-infinity. This is joint work with M. Dafermos and I. Rodnianski.
