The Euclidean &Phi;<sup>4</sup><sub>2</sub> theory as the limit of an interacting Bose gas

Abstract: <br><br>

Gibbs measures of nonlinear Schr&ouml;dinger equations are a fundamental object used
to study low-regularity solutions with random initial data. In the dispersive
PDE community, this point of view was pioneered by Bourgain in the 1990s. On the
other hand, the nonlinear Schr&ouml;dinger equation can be viewed a classical limit
of many-body quantum theory. We are interested in the problem of the derivation
of Gibbs measures as mean-field limits of Gibbs states in many-body quantum
mechanics.

The particular case we consider is when the dimension d=2 and when the
interaction potential is the delta function, which corresponds to the Euclidean
&Phi;<sup>4</sup><sub>2</sub> theory. The limit that we consider corresponds to taking the density
to be large and the range of the interaction to be small in a controlled way.
Our proof is based on two main ingredients.

        functional integral representation. </li>
    <li> A Nelson-type estimate for a nonlocal field theory in two dimensions. </li>
