<em>  On the point spectrum of periodic block Jacobi matrices
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
The periodic Jacobi matrices on the half line with matrix entries is the talk topic. We consider the location and amount of the eigenvalues of Block Jacobi matrices,including ones embedded into absolutely continuous spectrum. The talk is based on the joint work with J.Janas ( Krakow).
