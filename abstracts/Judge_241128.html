<em> 
Shrinking targets for affine automorphisms of Riemann surfaces
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

For a given ergodic dynamical system (T,X,&mu;) and a given measurable set A, the
set of points x whose iterates intersect A infinitely has full measure. We think
of A as a 'target'. To make the carnival game more difficult, we replace A with
a sequence of sets A<sub>n</sub> whose measure tends to zero. One then asks how fast the
A<sub>n</sub> can shrink and we can still hit them&mdash; T<sup>n</sup> x in
A<sub>n</sub>&mdash;with x in a full
measure set. We will consider the shrinking target problem for the action of the
group of self-diffeomorphsims of a Riemann surface that are affine with respect
to a holomorphic 1-form on X. We use a mean ergodic theorem for SL<sub>2</sub>(R) and work
of Avila-Gou&euml;zel to obtain estimates on the size of the targets. This is joint
work with Josh Southerland.
