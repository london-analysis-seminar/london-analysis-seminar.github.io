Plasmons: a new type of resonances from transmission boundary conditions
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

Wave scattering is ubiquitous in nature, it is one of the most important
phenomena in physics. One of the key objects in the study of scattering theory
are the so-called resonances. I will briefly talk about classical pictures of
obstacle scattering resonances and give a mathematical description of
transmission problems. Then I will discuss how geometry and refraction indices
influence the distribution of resonances. Obstacles with negative index of
refraction exhibit a new type of resonances called (surface) plasmons. We will
discuss when they are present for non-trapping obstacles and then I will briefly
go over how Jeffrey Galkowski and I capture plasmons.
