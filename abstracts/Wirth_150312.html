<em> Dispersive estimates for hyperbolic systems </em><br />
<br />
Abstract:
Dispersive estimates for (constant coefficient) hyperbolic
systems are intimately connected to geometric properties of associated
Fresnel surfaces. In variable coefficient settings this is replaced by
properties of families of surfaces. The talk will provide some
detailed results for time-dependent hyperbolic systems where
representations of solutions are almost explicit and give some hints
for further generalisations.
The talk is based on joint work with Michael Ruzhansky.
