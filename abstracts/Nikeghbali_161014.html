<em>  The CUE and the Riemann zeta function: the microscopic landscape </em><br />
<br />
Abstract: 
We provide some convergence results for the characteristic polynomial of random unitary matrices 
on the microscopic scale and as a consequence establish several facts about ratios 
of characteristic polynomials and correlations for the log of the characteristic polynomial, 
thus answering some open problems on that scale. 
These answers exhibit a natural random analytic function. 
We shall also give evidence about the connection between this object and the 
Riemann zeta function and its logarithmic derivative.
