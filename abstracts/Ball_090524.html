Title: Rational approximations to the zeta function 
<br><br>


Abstract: 
I will describe a sequence of rational functions which converge locally
uniformly to zeta. These functions can be expressed as the determinants of
certain very simple matrices. These in turn correspond to finite-dimensional
sections of the operators proposed by Connes and Berry-Keating as operators
whose spectra are the zeroes of zeta.
