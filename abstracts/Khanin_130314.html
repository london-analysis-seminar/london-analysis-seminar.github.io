<em>  KPZ Universality and Random Hamilton-Jacobi Equation </em><br />
<br />
Abstract: 
Universal properties related to the KPZ equation is
an extremely active research area. It is 
connected to many different areas in mathematics
and mathematical physics: probability theory and statistical
mechanics, PDEs, random matrices, integrable systems,
and others. Despite recent progress, mainly  in deriving exact formulas 
for correlation functions, the problem of universality is still largely open. 
We shall discuss some recent results in this direction.
