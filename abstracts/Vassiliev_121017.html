<em>  Classification of first order sesquilinear forms
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br> We work with n complex-valued scalar fields over an m-dimensional real manifold M without boundary. Our object of study is a first order Hermitian sesquilinear form, i.e. an integral over the manifold whose integrand is a linear combination of terms "product of gradient of scalar field and scalar field" and "product of two scalar fields".

<br>

We call two sesquilinear forms equivalent if one is obtained from the other by some x-dependent GL(n,C) transformation, i.e. by a change of basis in the vector space of n-tuples of complex-valued scalar fields. Our aim is to provide an explicit description of equivalence classes of sesquilinear forms.

<br>

The main result of the talk is that in the special case m=4, n=2 we provide explicit necessary and sufficient conditions for two sesquilinear forms to be equivalent. In the process of formulating these necessary and sufficient conditions we show that a first order Hermitian sesquilinear form implicitly contains geometric constructs such as Lorentzian metric, spin structure, connection coefficients and electromagnetic covector potential.

<br>

The talk is based on the paper "Analytic definition of spin structure".
