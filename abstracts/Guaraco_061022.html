<em>Solving Plateau's problem via semilinear elliptic equations</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

The smooth version of Plateau's problem is to show the existence of a regular
minimal surface with any given smooth boundary curve in &#x211D;<sup>3</sup>.  Historically,
studying problems of this type required the framework of Geometric Measure
Theory, e.g. the theory of currents. However, I will discuss how new techniques
allow us to tackle this and other problems with usual tools from Analysis and
PDE, in particular, via understanding the level set regularity of solutions to
semilinear elliptic equations. This is joint work with Stephen Lynch.
