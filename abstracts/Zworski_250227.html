<em>
Classical/Quantum correspondence in Lindblad evolution
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

Lindblad evolution is a standard model for describing a
(Markovian) quantum interaction with a larger system.
I will introduce this concept and present results showing that the
evolution of a quantum observable remains close to the classical
Fokker&ndashl;Planck evolution in the Hilbert&ndash;Schmidt norm for times vastly
exceeding the Ehrenfest time (the limit of such agreement with no
interaction with a larger system). The time scale is the same as in
two recent papers by Hern&aacute;ndez&ndash;Ranard&ndash;Riedel but the statement and
methods are different. The talk is based on joint work with J
Galkowski and numerical results obtained jointly with Z Huang. I will
also comment on recent progress on trace class estimates by Z Li and
on the hypoelliptic case by H Smith.
