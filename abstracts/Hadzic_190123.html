<em> On gravitational Landau damping </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

We consider a family of compactly supported inhomogeneous steady states to the
gravitational Vlasov-Poisson system with a point mass at the origin. They are
parametrised by the polytropic index k&#62;1/2, which measures the regularity of
the steady state. We prove the following sharp dichotomy result: if k&#62;1 the
linear perturbations Landau damp (i.e. equilibrate in a suitable sense) and if
1/2 &#60; k &#60; 1 they do not.


This dichotomy is a new phenomenon and highlights the role of steady state
regularity in the discussion of long-time behaviour of (linear)
perturbations. The key ingredient in the proof of damping is the
exclusion of embedded eigenvalues inside the essential spectrum. The
key ingredient in the proof of no damping (1/2 &#60; k &#60; 1) is a suitable
version of the Birman-Schwinger principle adapted to the problem at
hand. Joint work with G. Rein, M. Schrecker, C. Straub.
