<em>  Products of matrices depending on a parameter and spectral theory. </em><br />
<br />
Abstract: 

Products of random matrices depending on a parameter arise naturally in the context of the spectral theory of random Schrodinger operators. First results concerning the asymptotic behaviour of such (and more general) products of matrices were obtained in 1975. The interest to this topic was revived due to the study of non-self-adjoint Anderson model. In this talk, I'll review
(a) some old results concerned with both the general products and those arising in the spectral theory;
(b) the interaction between the theory of products of matrices and the spectral theory.
If time permits, I'll also discuss some open questions relating the two theories.
