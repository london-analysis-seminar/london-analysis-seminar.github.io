<em>The interior behavior of Steklov Eigenfunctions</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
The Steklov problem consists of studying the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the Dirichlet to Neumann map on a compact manifold, M, with boundary. While the high energy behavior of the eigenfunctions on the boundary of M resembles that of high energy Laplace eigenfunctions, their behavior in the interior of M is very different. In this talk, we discuss the decay and oscillatory properties of these eigenfunctions in the interior of M.
