Title: Linear isometries on the Fr&eacute;chet space of holomorphic functions on the open unit disc 
<br><br>


Abstract: 
Let X be a topological space of holomorphic functions on the open unit disc $D$.
The study of the geometry of a space X is
centered on the identification of the linear isometries on X, and there is an obvious connection between weighted composition operators
and isometries. This connection can be traced back to Banach himself and emphasized by Forelli,  El-Gebeily, Wolfe, Kolaski, Cima, Wogen,
Colonna and many others.

A characterisation is given of all the linear isometries
of Hol (D), the Fr&eacute;chet space of all holomorphic functions on the unit disc D, when it is given one of the two
standard metrics. Operators similar to an isometry are also classified. Further, the
larger class of operators   isometric when restricted to one
of the defining seminorms is identified.
