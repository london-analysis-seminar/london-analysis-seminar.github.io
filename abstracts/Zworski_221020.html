<em>  Analytic hypoellipticity of Keldysh operators</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

For operators modeled by $ P = x_1 D_{x_1}^2+ D_{x_2}^2+a
D_{x_1} $  we show that if $ u $ is smooth and $ Pu$  is analytic then
$ u$ is analytic. This is motivated by the question of analyticity of
quasinormal modes of black holes across event horizons and is a
consequence of a general microlocal result. Joint work with J Galkowski.
