Title: Singular measures and convergence to volume in negative curvature.

<br><br>

Abstract: <br>
A theorem of Bowen (1972) asserts that the periodic orbits
of a geodesic flow over a compact surface of constant negative
curvature, with periods in an interval [T-a,T+a], become
equidistributed with respect to the Liouville measure as T tends to
infinity. A sharper version due to Zelditch (1989) gives a rate of
convergence and hence equidistribution when the interval shrinks as T
increases. In variable negative curvature, the periodic orbits are no
longer equidistributed with respect to Liouville measure but, by a
result of Parry (1986), an appropriately weighted average is. We will
discuss results where the interval is allowed to shrink in this
setting. This is joint work with Mark Pollicott.
