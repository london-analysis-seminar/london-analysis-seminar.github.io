Title: Highly nonlinear large-competition limits of elliptic systems

<br><br>

Abstract: 
<br>
In this talk, I will discuss the effect of different types of
competitive
interaction terms on the large-interaction limit of nonlinear elliptic
systems
modelling the steady states of populations that compete in some region. As
the competition rate tends to infinity,  non-negative solutions of quite
simple-looking
systems converge to the positive and negative parts of  solutions of a
scalar limit
problem  which may be much more strongly nonlinear than the original
system,
possibly with quadratic growth in the gradient of the limit function.
This is joint
work with Norman Dancer.
