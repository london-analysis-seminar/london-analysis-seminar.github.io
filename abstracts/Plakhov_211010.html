Title: Extremal properties of billiards  <br />
<br />
Abstract:  <br />
We consider billiard scattering by bounded bodies, that is, connected sets with piecewise smooth boundary. We provide construction of perfectly streamlined bodies and bodies with the worst possible streamlining. The former examples include bodies having zero resistance to an incident parallel flow of point particles and bodies (with mirror surface) invisible in one direction. The latter examples include asymptotically perfect retroreflectors; that is, bodies with mirror surface that reverse the direction of any incident beam of light.
