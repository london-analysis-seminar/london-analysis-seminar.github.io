<em>  Random and pseudo-random Taylor series.
A Walk in the Littlewood and Offord footsteps. </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: 
We describe a recent progress in understanding the distribution of zeroes
of various classes of Taylor series with random or pseudo-random coefficients.
These results answer several questions left open by Littlewood and Offord.
The talk is based on joint works with Alexander Borichev, Fedor Nazarov,
and Alon Nishry.
