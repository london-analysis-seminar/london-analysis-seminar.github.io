<em>  Critical well-posedness for the Cubic Dirac equation </em><br />
<br />
Abstract: 
We outline recent work towards a global well-posedness theory for the massless cubic 
Dirac equation for small, scale invariant data in spatial dimensions n = 2, 3.  
The main difficulty is the lack of available Strichartz estimates for the Dirac equation 
in low dimensions. To overcome this, there are two main steps. 
The first is a construction of the null frame spaces of Tataru 
that is adapted to the Dirac equation, and which form a suitable replacement 
for certain missing endpoint Strichartz estimates. 
The second is a number of bilinear and trilinear estimates that exploit the null structure 
of the equation.
