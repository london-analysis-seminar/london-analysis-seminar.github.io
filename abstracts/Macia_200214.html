<em>  Dispersion and observability for completely integrable Schr&ouml;dinger flows </em><br />
<br />
Abstract: 
I will present some results on weak dispersion and unique continuation 
(observability) for linear Schr&ouml;dinger equations that are obtained as 
the quantization of a completely integrable Hamiltonian system.  
The model case corresponds to the linear Schr&ouml;dinger equation 
(with a potential) on the flat torus. 
Our results are obtained through a detailed analysis 
of semiclassical measures corresponding to sequences of solutions, 
which is performed using a two-microlocal approach. 
This is a joint work with Nalini Anantharaman and Clotilde Fermanian-Kammerer.
