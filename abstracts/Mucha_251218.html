<em>
    The Euler System with Fuzzy Pressure
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

In this talk, I will present a modified version of the compressible barotropic Euler system with
friction, where a nonlocal, "fuzzy" pressure term replaces the traditional pressure. This nonlocal pressure is parameterized by 
&epsilon;>0, with the system formally converging to the classical pressure
model as &epsilon; approaches zero. The main objective is to demonstrate that this modified system reliably
approximates the classical compressible Euler system. Our findings are parameter-independent,
allowing us to rigorously establish the convergence of solutions to those of the classical Euler
system. An additional result is a rigorous derivation of the mass equation converging to various
forms of the porous media equation as friction tends to infinity. This analysis is carried out in
the whole space, which requires the use of an appropriate L<sup>1</sup>-in-time framework.
