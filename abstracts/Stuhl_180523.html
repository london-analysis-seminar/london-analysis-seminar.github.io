<em> Sphere-packings on lattices in statistical mechanics   </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

I will discuss dense-packing problems on some two and three dimensional lattices
and show their role in the analysis of the phase diagram of the hard-core model.
Namely, the high-density pure phases/extreme Gibbs distributions of the model
are generated by certain ground states - according to the Pirogov-Sinai theory -
which are dense-packings for this model in the high-density regime.
