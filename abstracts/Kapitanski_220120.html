Abstract: <br>
In nonlinear elasticity theory there is a class of models that can be derived 
from an action functional with the potential energy described by a strain 
energy density function. These are the hyperelastic materials. The simplest 
example is the Neo-Hookean material (like some plastics, biological tissues, 
or rubber). In this talk, after describing the equations of motion of an incompressible 
neo-Hookean material, I will concentrate on the Cauchy problem for those equations. 
There are similarities with the Euler equations of fluid dynamics, 
and there are major differences. I will show some new analytical tools that help 
with the low regularity well-posedness results.   
Based on joint work with Lars Andersson.
