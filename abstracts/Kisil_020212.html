<em> The Heisenberg group, PDO and Toeplitz operators </em><br />
<br />
Abstract: The Heisenberg group and its representations are behind many key
  results in harmonic analysis, quantum mechanics, etc. Moreover, the
  Heisenberg group is a bridge allowing profitable exchanges of ideas and
  techniques between those fields. The talk will present several
  illustrations for this.
