<em>  Landau damping: Gevrey regularity and paraproducts </em><br />
<br />
Abstract: 
We present the key ideas of a new proof of Landau damping for the Vlasov-Poisson equation 
obtained in a joint work with Bedrossian and Masmoudi. 
This nonlinear transport equation is a fundamental model for describing self-interacting plasmas 
or galaxies, and Landau damping is a nonlinear stability mechanism based on phase mixing. 
The new method does not use a Newton scheme and seems to capture a critical Gevrey regularity 
for the damping. 
Moreover its greater flexibility should open the way to further work, and we will finish 
by sketching some open questions.​
