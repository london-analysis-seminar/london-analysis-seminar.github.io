Operator Lipschitz functions, Boyd indices and
applications
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

We will discuss Operator J-Lipschitz functions for symmetrically normed ideals
J. The smoothness of these functions depends on the Boyd indices of the ideals.
We will consider the notion of interpolation spaces and why we need these spaces
to describe the smoothness of J-Lipschitz functions. Additionally, we will try
to examine some applications:
<ol>
    <li>Distance to normal elements in C<sup>&ast;</sup>-algebras, </li>
     <li> Gateaux and Fr&eacute;chet
     differentiability  of operator functions,</li>
     <li> Actions of J-Lipschitz functions on the domains of derivations.</li>
     </ol>
Realizing that this is too ambitious for a 1-hour talk, we will try not to get
bogged down in too many details while, nevertheless, giving a comparatively full
picture of this part of the theory of Operator Lipschitz functions.
