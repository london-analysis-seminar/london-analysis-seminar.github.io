<em>  Uniqueness Theorems on Asymptotically Anti-de Sitter Spacetimes
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>


In theoretical physics, it is often conjectured that a correspondence exists 
between the gravitational dynamics of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes 
and a conformal field theory of their boundaries. 
In the context of classical relativity, one can attempt to rigorously formulate 
a correspondence statement as a unique continuation problem for PDEs: 
Is an asymptotically AdS solution of the Einstein equations uniquely determined by its data 
on its conformal boundary at infinity?

In this presentation, we establish a key step in toward a positive result; 
we prove an analogous unique continuation result for linear and nonlinear wave equations 
on fixed asymptotically AdS spacetimes satisfying a positivity condition at infinity. 
We show, roughly, that if a wave \phi on this spacetime vanishes 
on a sufficiently large but finite portion of its conformal boundary, 
then \phi must also vanish in a neighbourhood of the boundary. 
In particular, we highlight the analytic and geometric features of AdS spacetimes 
which enable this uniqueness result, as well as obstacles preventing such a result from holding in other cases.

This is joint work with Gustav Holzegel.
