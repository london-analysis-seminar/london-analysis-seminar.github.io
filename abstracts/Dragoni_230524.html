Title: Semiconcavity of the square distance in Carnot groups. 
<br><br>


Abstract: 
Semiconcavity and semiconvexity are key regularity properties for functions with many applications in a broad range of mathematical subjects. The notions of semiconcavity and semiconvexity have been adapted to different geometrical contexts, in particular in sub-Riemannian structures such as Carnot groups, where they turn out to be extremely useful for the study of solutions of degenerate PDEs.
In this talk I will show that, for a suitable class of Carnot groups, the Carnot-Carathéodory distance is semiconcave, in the sense of the group, in the whole space.
I will also give some applications to solutions of non-coercive Hamilton-Jacobi equations.
