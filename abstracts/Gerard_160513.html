<em>  BMO solutions of the cubic Szego equation </em><br />
<br />
Abstract:
The cubic Szego equation is a recently introduced toy model
of a Hamiltonian evolution PDE with lack of dispersion. I will show how
the Lax pair structure of this equation allows to define a global
Hamiltonian flow
on the Hardy version of John-Nirenberg's BMO space on the circle,
and describe some qualitative properties of these singular solutions.
