<em> Blow-up of critical spatial norms at any Navier-Stokes singular time </em><br />

Abstract: Consider a Besov space X=X(R^3) which is invariant under the spatial 
scaling of the Navier-Stokes equations and for which a local existence 
theory for any initial datum in X has been developed.  We show that for 
any local Navier-Stokes solution u starting from an initial datum u_0 in X 
and which (hypothetically) has a singularity at time T>0, the (spatial) X 
norm of u(.,t) must become unbounded as t approaches T.  This extends a 
famous result of Escauriaza-Seregin-Sverak (2003) which establishes the 
same result for X=L^3(R^3), which is continuously embedded in all of the 
Besov spaces mentioned above.  Our proof uses profile decompositions for 
bounded sequences in Banach spaces as well as the related "critical 
element" theory developed for and implemented in the setting of critical 
dispersive and hyperbolic equations by C. Kenig and F. Merle.  The program 
for Navier-Stokes (the first parabolic setting in which the critical 
element method was successfully implemented) was started in collaboration 
with Carlos Kenig (Chicago) and completed in collaboration with Isabelle 
Gallagher (Paris) and Fabrice Planchon (Nice).  As a by-product of the 
tools developed for this program, we were able to easily extend a recent 
result of Rusin-Sverak regarding "minimal blow-up data" for Navier-Stokes 
in critical spaces to all of the spaces mentioned above.
