On Computing the Spectrum and Essential Spectrum of Band-Dominated Operators on the Axis and Half-Axis
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

In this talk I will describe work, with Marko Lindner and Ratchanikorn
Chonchaiya, on deriving convergent sequences of inclusion sets for the spectrum,
essential spectrum, and pseudospectrum, of bounded linear operators whose matrix
representation is banded or band-dominated. These methods are based on
computations of the injection modulus/lower norm of square or rectangular finite
sections, using ideas introduced in the self-adjoint case by Davies and Plum
(IMA J. Numer. Anal., 2004), and extended to the non-self-adjoint case by Hansen
(J. Funct. Anal., 2008). As an application of our general results we consider
operators that are pseudo-ergodic in the sense of Davies (Comm. Math. Phys.,
2001), for example the Feinberg-Zee random hopping matrix introduced in Feinberg
and Zee (Phys. Rev. E, 1999) and studied in Chandler-Wilde and Davies (J.
Spectr. Theory, 2012).
