Brenier-type theorem for infinite-valued costs and set dualities
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

Given a cost function and two probability measures, the optimal transport
problem is that of finding a transport map (or a plan) which minimises total
cost. The case of finite-valued costs is well-understood and, under mild
assumptions, the optimal plan has a special geometric structure. In particular,
there exists a function, which we call a potential, whose c-subgradient contains
the support of the optimal transport plan (for the quadratic cost
|x-y|<sup>2</sup> the
gradient of the potential is famously known as the Brenier map). However, if a
cost function attains infinite values, which corresponds to prohibiting certain
pairs of points to be mapped to one another, only special families of costs were
studied. We present a unified approach to transportation with respect to
infinite-valued costs: we discuss compatibility of measures involved, give a
sufficient condition for the existence of a Brenier-type map, and explain how
this condition gives rise to abstract dualities on sets.
