<em>  Moser meets (nonlinear) Schrödinger </em><br />

<br />

Abstract: 

Back in the 1970s, Jurgen Moser proved complete integrability of a class of classical many-body systems, which are now referred to as Calogero-Moser (CM) systems. In fact, these CM-systems (and its quantum mechanical counterparts) have become a household name in mathematical physics. In this talk, I will give an expository introduction to a newly found PDE that arises as in the continuum limit of classical CM-systems, leading to the so-called critical Calogero-Moser nonlinear Schrodinger equation (CM-NLS). I will try to highlight its striking analytical features by discussing multi-soliton solutions, turbulence (growth of Sobolev norms), blowup, and its Lax pair structures. If time permits, I will discuss some key open problems in the theory. My talk is based on joint work with Patrick Gerard (Paris-Sud) and Maria Ahrend (Basel).
