<em> Anderson Localization vs Many-Body Localization: Some Examples </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
The mathematical reasons for Anderson localization, i.e., that the introduction of disorder into a one-particle (non-interacting) quantum system can suppress quantum transport, are reasonably well understood. Much less is known, however, about many-body localization, asking if this phenomenon persists if interactions are considered. We will use examples from quantum spin systems to try to describe some of the similarities as well as differences between the one-body and many-body case.
