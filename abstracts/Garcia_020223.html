Self-similar spirals for the generalized surface quasi-geostrophic equations
<em>  </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

In this talk, we will construct a large class of non-trivial (non radial)
self-similar solutions of the generalized surface quasi-geostrophic equation. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first rigorous construction of any
self-similar solution for these equations. Moreover, the solutions are of spiral
type, locally integrable and may have a change of sign. This is a joint work
with Javier G&oacute;mez-Serrano.
