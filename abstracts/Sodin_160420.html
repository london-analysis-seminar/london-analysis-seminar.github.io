<em>On the change of variable \lambda to \sqrt{\lambda}  (with an application in spectral theory)</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
We shall discuss two applications of the change of variables  \lambda to \sqrt{\lambda}, conjugated by the Fourier transform, to uniqueness problems in classical analysis. One of these allows to re-prove and generalise a recent result of Borichev-Frank-Volberg, which provides a bound on the number of eigenvalues of a non-selfadjoint Schrodinger operator with fast-decaying potential.
