We will first recall some classical geometric inequalities for hypersurfaces in Euclidean space, where equality holds if and only if the hypersurface is a geodesic sphere. The upper bounds involve isoperimetric ratio and mean curvature terms. We then observe that these inequalities arise from a lower bound on the $L^2$-norm of the position vector and derive stability results from a general pinching result of the moment of inertia.
