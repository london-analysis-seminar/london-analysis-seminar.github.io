<em>Concentration and Growth of Laplace Eigenfunctions</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
In this talk we will discuss a new approach to understanding eigenfunction concentration. We characterize the features that cause an eigenfunction to saturate the standard supremum bounds in terms of the distribution of L^2 mass along geodesic tubes emanating from a point. We also show that the phenomena behind extreme supremum norm growth is identical to that underlying extreme growth of eigenfunctions when averaged along submanifolds. Finally, we use these ideas to understand a variety of measures of concentration; in each case obtaining quantitative improvements over the known bounds.
