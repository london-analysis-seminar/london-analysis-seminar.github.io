<em> Ballistic transport for one-dimensional quasiperiodic Schrödinger operator </em><br />

<br />

Abstract: We show that one-dimensional discrete multi-frequency quasiperiodic Schrödinger operators with smooth potentials demonstrate ballistic motion on the set of energies on which the corresponding Schrödinger cocycles are smoothly reducible to constant rotations. The proof is performed by establishing a local version of strong ballistic transport on an exhausting sequence of subsets on which reducibility can be achieved by a conjugation uniformly bounded in the C^{ell}-norm. We also establish global strong ballistic transport under an additional integral condition on the norms of conjugation matrices. The latter condition is quite mild and is satisfied in many known examples. The talk is based on joint results with Lingrui Ge
