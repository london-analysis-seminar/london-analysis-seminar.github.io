<I>
On sharp space-time estimates for solutions 
to some linear dispersive equations
</I>

<br><br> 

Abstract: 
<br>

 I will begin with a discussion of sharp constants and
extremisers
for L^p space-time estimates (or Strichartz estimates) for solutions of
the homogeneous Schrodinger and wave equations with initial data in
L^2
or, more generally, certain Sobolev spaces. The majority of my talk will
concern such sharpness considerations for certain weighted L^2
space-time
estimates (or smoothing estimates) in which case we may consider a larger
class of dispersive equations.
