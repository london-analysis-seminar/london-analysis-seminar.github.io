<em>   Heat flow, Harnack inequalities, and optimal transportation </em><br />
<br />
Abstract: The talk will develop heat flow methods towards functional
Sobolev-type inequalities and parabolic Harnack inequalities in
the context of diffusion operators with curvature bounded from below.
Through heat kernel inequalities, connections to optimal transportation
and heat flow contraction properties along Wasserstein distances
are emphasized.
