    Spectral reduction and zero modes of the Weyl&ndash;Dirac operator
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

For a given magnetic potential A one can define the Weyl&ndash;Dirac operator
&sigma;&middot;(-i&nabla;-A)$ on &reals;<sup>3</sup>.
The question of whether or not this operator possess a zero-energy
L<sup>2</sup> eigenfunction, or <em>zero mode</em>, is quite subtle.
We review some known results, including recent work on a conjecture for asymptotics in the strong field (or semi-classical) regime.
In particular, we look at cases where the magnetic field is parallel to a conformal Killing field; such a symmetry can be exploited to reduce spectral questions to the consideration of a family of two dimensional Dirac-type problems.
A complication arises as the basic two dimensional object involves a quotient by a typically non-proper action. Nevertheless, estimates for the existence of zero modes of the original Dirac operator can be obtained.
