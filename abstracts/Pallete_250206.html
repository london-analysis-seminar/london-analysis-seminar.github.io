On the topology and index of minimal/Bryant framed surfaces
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

In this talk we'll discuss a 1-to-1 correspondence between Euclidean minimal and
Bryant surfaces, known in the literature as Lawson's correspondence. Along this
correspondence we will study framed surfaces, which is a class of Euclidean
minimal and hyperbolic CMC-1 surfaces that generalize immersed Euclidean minimal
surfaces and Bryant surfaces. For this class we prove a lower bound on the
(unrestricted) Morse index by a linear function of the genus, number of ends and
number of branch points (counting multiplicity), generalizing previous work in
the literature. This is joint work with Davi Maximo.
