<em>  The Bohm potential and a regularized system of self-gravitating particles </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>
We consider a regularized macroscopic model describing a system of 
self-gravitating particles. 
We study the existence and uniqueness of nonnegative solutions 
and allude the differences to results obtained from classical gravitational models.
