<em>  Quantitative Hydrodynamic Limits of Stochastic Lattice Systems</em><br />
<br />
Abstract: 
In this talk, I will present a simple abstract quantitative method for proving the hydrodynamic limit of interacting particle systems on a lattice, both in the hyperbolic and parabolic scaling. In the latter case, the convergence rate is uniform in time. This "consistency-stability" approach combines a modulated Wasserstein-distance estimate comparing the law of the stochastic process to the local Gibbs measure, together with stability estimates à la Kruzhkov in weak distance, and consistency estimates exploiting the regularity of the limit solution. It avoids the use of “block estimates” and is self-contained. We apply it to the simple exclusion process, the zero range process, and the Ginzburg-Landau process with Kawasaki dynamics. This is a joint work with Daniel Marahrens and Angeliki Menegaki (IHES).
