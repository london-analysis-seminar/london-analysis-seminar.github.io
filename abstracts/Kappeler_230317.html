Abstract: <br>

In form of a case study, I survey the ‘nonlinear Fourier‘ method to solve 
nonlinear dispersive equations such as the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) 
equation or the nonlinear Schroedinger (NLS) equation. A key ingredient 
for desribing the solutions are the frequencies, associated to such type 
of equations. A novel approach of representing them allows to extend 
the solution map of such equations to spaces of low regularity and to 
study its regularity properties. Potential applications include results 
for stochastic versions of the evolution equations considered.
This is joint work with Jan Molnar.
