<em> Approximation of functions of differential operators </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
We will discuss recent advancements in approximation of operator
functions that arise in problems of mathematical physics and
noncommutative geometry. Those questions reduce to finding nice bounds
and representations for (semi)-norms of approximation errors.
Challenges arise, in particular, from noncommutativity of a
perturbation and initial unbounded operator and from noncompactness of
the perturbation. Successful resolution rests on multilinear operator
integration, a powerful technical method with a long history in
noncommutative analysis.<br>
