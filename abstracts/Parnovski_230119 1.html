<em>  Floating mats and sloping beaches: spectral asymptotics of the Steklov problem on polygons  </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
I will discuss the asymptotic behaviour of the eigenvalues of the Steklov problem (aka Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator) on curvilinear polygons. The answer is completely unexpected and depends on the arithmetic properties of the angles of the polygon.
