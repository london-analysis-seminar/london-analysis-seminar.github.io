<em> Diffusion and mixing for two-dimensional Hamiltonian flows  </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

We consider general two-dimensional autonomous velocity fields and prove that
their mixing and dissipation features are limited to algebraic rates. As an
application, we consider a standard cellular flow on a periodic box, and explore
potential consequences for the long-time dynamics in the two-dimensional Euler
equations.
