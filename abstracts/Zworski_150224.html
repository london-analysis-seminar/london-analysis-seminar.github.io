<em> Optimal enhanced dissipation for geodesic flow </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

We consider geodesic flows on negatively curved compact
manifolds or more generally contact Anosov flows (all these concepts
will be explained). The object is to show that if X is the
generator of the flow and &Delta;, a (negative) Laplacian, then
solutions to the convection diffusion equation, &#8706;<sub>t</sub> u = X u
+ &Delta;u,  u &#8805; 0, satisfy
<br>
&parallel; u(t) - <u>u</u> &parallel;<sub>L&sup2;(M) </sub> &le; C
u<sup>-K</sup> e<sup>-&beta;t</sup> &parallel; u(0)&parallel;<sub>L&sup2;(M)
</sub>,
<br>
where <u>u</u> is the (conserved) average of u(0) with
respect to the contact volume form and K is a fixed constant. This
provides many examples of very precise <em>optimal enhanced
    dissipation</em> in the sense of recent works of
Bedrossian&ndash;Blumenthal&ndash;Punshon-Smith and Elgindi&ndash;Liss&ndash;Mattingly. The
proof is based on results by Dyatlov and the speaker on stochastic
stability of Pollicott&dash;Ruelle resonances, another concept which will
be introduced and explained. The talk is based on joint work with
Zhongkai Tao.
