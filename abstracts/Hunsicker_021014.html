<em>  A Hodge Theorem for Intersection Space Cohomology </em><br />
<br />
Abstract: 
Intersection space cohomology is a new family of (co)homologies defined on singular spaces.
This talk will introduce the theory and its relationship to mirror symmetry, and will present a relationship
between the theory and the now more classical theory of intersection (co)homology as well as a Hodge
theorem relating the spaces to spaces of harmonic forms.
