Abstract: <br><br>

We present a new method for finding eigenvalue asymptotics for polynomially
compact, zero order, pseudodifferential operators. As an application we find
asymptotics of the spectrum of the Neumann-Poincar&eacute; (double layer potential)
integral operator of the 3D linear elasticity. We find relations of the
geometrical characteristics of surface and the spectrum of the NP operator.
