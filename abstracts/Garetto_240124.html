<em> Higher order hyperbolic equations with multiplicities </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

In this talk I will discuss Gevrey and C<sup>&infin;</sup> well-posedness for linear higher
order hyperbolic equations with multiplicities. I will review the different
methods employed for time- and/or x-dependent coefficients and the conditions
needed on the lower order terms. Work in collaboration with Michael Ruzhanksy
(Ghent/QMUL) and Bolys Sabibtek (QMUL).
