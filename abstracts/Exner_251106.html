Geometric effects in soft waveguides spectra
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

Remembering one of the many topics Brian contributed to, I am going to discuss
the discrete spectrum induced by geometric perturbations of systems that may
regarded as a soft version of a Dirichlet quantum waveguides. I will focus on
two particular examples. One is a two-dimensional Schr ̈odinger operator with the
potential in the form of a channel of fixed profile built over a curve which is
not straight but it is straight outside a compact. The second one concerns a
sort of soft waveguide with a longitudinal periodic structure, specifically an
array of potential wells. Here I again consider perturbations which preserve the
array structure outside a compact region and in this case higher dimensions will
be allowed. I will also mention some open problems.
