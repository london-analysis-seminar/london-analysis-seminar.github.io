<em>  Composition operators on Hardy space 
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>

The topic of the talk is composition operators $C_\phi: f\to f\circ\phi$,  where the symbol $\phi$  is an analytic function from the open unit disc of the complex plane into itself.  We restrict our attention to the case of  composition operators acting on Hardy spaces $H^p$. We shall give a (non exhaustive!) overview of old and recent results, as well as open questions around that subject. We shall focus on the membership of various ideal operators.
