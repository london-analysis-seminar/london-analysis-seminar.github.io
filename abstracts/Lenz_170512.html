<em>  Large time behaviour of heat kernels </em><br />
<br />
Abstract: 
We study long time behaviour of heat kernels and show
convergence of the semigroup to the ground state and convergence of
suitably averaged logarithms of kernels to the ground state energy.
The results hold for arbitrary selfadjoint positivity improving
semigroups. This framework includes Laplace operator  on manifolds, on
graphs and on quantum graphs. (Joint work with  Matthias Keller,
