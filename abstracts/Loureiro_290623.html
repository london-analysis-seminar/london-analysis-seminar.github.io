An invitation for multiple orthogonality
<em>  </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

I will invite you for a journey into the world of multiple orthogonal
polynomials. These consist of a sequence of polynomials in a single variable and
on a multi-index whose orthogonality is spread across a vector of measures. The
main focus will be on those whose multi-index lies on the step line. They
satisfy a number of properties that somehow mimic some observed in standard
orthogonality. For instance, they satisfy linear recurrence relations of order
higher than two. Throughout the talk I will go through several examples of such
sequences and their overarching properties. Of course, the motivation and
applications of them will also be part of the discussion.
