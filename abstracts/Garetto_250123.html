<em> Non diagonalisable hyperbolic systems with multiplicity </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

In this talk, I will present some recent results on the
well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for non-diagonalisable
hyperbolic systems with multiplicities. In particular, I will provide a
representation formula for the solution and formulate Levi conditions
on the lower order terms. This is work in collaboration with Christian
Jäh (Göttingen University), Michael Ruzhansky (QMUL/Ghent University) and
Bolys Sabitbek (QMUL).
