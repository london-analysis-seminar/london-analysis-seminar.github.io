<em>
The lens rigidity problem in 2 dimensions.
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>
We will discuss aspects the geometric inverse problem of finding a Riemannian
metric on a manifold-with boundary, from knowledge of the lens map: Assume we
know the exit point and exit time for any geodesic that is shot into a manifold
from its boundary in any direction, can we reconstruct the metric? Can local
metric reconstruction be performed from local lens data? If the whole metric
cannot be reconstructed, how much of it can? Is the reconstruction stable? We
present recent work on these questions, for 2-dimensional metrics.  Some brief
discussion the relation of this work with wave inverse problems will also be
provided. Joint work with Matti Lassas.
