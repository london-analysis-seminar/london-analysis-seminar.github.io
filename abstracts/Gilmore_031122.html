<em>  The dynamics of weighted composition operators on Fock space</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

The study of weighted composition operators acting on spaces of analytic
functions has recently developed into an active area of research. In particular,
characterisations of the bounded and compact weighted composition operators
acting on Fock spaces were identified by, amongst others, Ueki (2007), Le
(2014), and Tien and Khoi (2019).  
 
In this talk I will examine some recent results that give explicit descriptions
of bounded and compact weighted composition operators acting on Fock spaces.
This allows us to prove that Fock spaces do not support supercyclic weighted
composition operators. This is joint work with Tom Carroll (University College
Cork).
