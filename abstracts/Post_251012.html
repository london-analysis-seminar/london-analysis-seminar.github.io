<em> Approximating vertex conditions by geometry (joint work with Peter
Kuchment) </em><br />
<br />
Abstract: Our aim is to approximate a class of vertex conditions for a Laplacian
on a metric graph by Laplacians on a family of manifolds shrinking to
the metric graph.  We characterise the class of vertex conditions in
terms of stochastic properties of the semi-group generated by the
Laplacian.
