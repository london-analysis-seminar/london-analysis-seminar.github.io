Best Sobolev constants in the presence of sharp Hardy terms

Abstract:

We consider sharp Hardy inequalities and study how they may be
improved by adding Sobolev terms with explicit constants. This is carried
out for interior point singularity in Euclidean and hyperbolic space and
also for a boundary point singularity in Euclidean space.
