<em>Existence and weak-strong uniqueness of measure solutions to
    Euler&ndash;alignment/Aw&ndash;Rascle&ndash;Zhang model of collective behaviour  </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

I will discuss the multi-dimensional Euler&ndash;alignment system with a matrix-valued
communication kernel, which is motivated by models of anticipation dynamics in
collective behaviour. A key feature of this system is its formal equivalence to
a nonlocal variant of the Aw&ndash;Rascle&ndash;Zhang (ARZ) traffic model, in which the
desired velocity is modified by a nonlocal gradient interaction. The
global-in-time existence of measure solutions to both formulations,  can be
obtained via a single degenerate pressureless Navier&ndash;Stokes approximation. I
will also discuss a weak&ndash;strong uniqueness principle adapted to the
pressureless setting and to nonlocal alignment forces. As a consequence of these results we
can rigorously justify the formal correspondence between the nonlocal
ARZ and Euler&ndash;alignment models: they arise from the same inviscid limit,
and the
weak&ndash;strong uniqueness property ensures that, whenever a classical solution
exists, both formulations coincide with it.
