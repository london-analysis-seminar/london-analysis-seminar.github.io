Sharp stability of the Brunn&ndash;Minkowski, Pr&eacute;kopa&ndash;Leindler and
Borell&ndash;Brascamp&ndash;Lieb inequalities
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>
The Borell&ndash;Brascamp&ndash;Lieb inequality is a generalization of the
Pr&eacute;kopa&ndash;Leindler inequality which in turn is a functional extension of the
Brunn&ndash;Minkowski inequality, which further implies the classical isoperimetric
inequality. The study of these fundamental geometric inequalities and their
stability has a rich history. We prove a sharp stability result for the
Brunn&ndash;Minkowski, Pr&eacute;kopa&ndash;Leindler and
Borell&ndash;Brascamp&ndash;Lieb inequalities thus
concluding a long line of research on this problem. This is joint work with
Alessio Figalli and Peter van Hintum.
