<em>  A conformal block approach to the connection problem
           of the third Painleve equation </em><br />
<br />
Abstract: 
In the recent series of papers of O. Gamayun, N. Igorov, O.
Lisovyy, A. Shchechkin, J. Teschner, and Yu. Tykhyy a novel  approach to
the analysis of the  Painleve equations has been suggested. The method
is based on the  Virasoro conformal block representation of the relevant
tau-functions, and it allows, in particular,  to  evaluate the constant
term in
the asymptotics of the  Painleve VI tau-function. It should be
mentioned that the evaluation
of the constant terms in the asymptotics of tau-fucntions is a very
serious challenge
for the usual Riemann-Hilbert isomonodromy  method. In the talk, the
conformal
block  technique will be extended  to the case of the third Painleve
equation.  A new feature which needs to be taken care of is the  presence
of the irregular  singularities in the problem.
This is the joint work with O. Lisovyy and Yu. Tykhyy.
