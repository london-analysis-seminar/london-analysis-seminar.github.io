<em> Small-amplitude steady water waves </em><br />
<br />
Abstract:<br>
The talk is devoted to the two-dimensional free-boundary problem describing steady gravity water waves in a channel of finite depth. A review of known results on small amplitude steady water waves in the case of potential flows and in the case when the flow has non-vanishing vorticity will be given. New results concerning a description of all water waves with general vorticity will be also presented. The latter is a joint work with E. Lokharu, Lund University.
