<em>  An index theorem for Lorentzian manifolds with boundary
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>

We show that the Dirac operator on a compact globally hyperbolic
Lorentzian spacetime with spacelike Cauchy boundary is a Fredholm
operator if appropriate boundary conditions are imposed. We prove that
the index of this operator is given by the same expression as in the
index formula of Atiyah-Patodi-Singer for Riemannian manifolds with
boundary. If time permits, an application to quantum field
theory (the computation of the chiral anomaly) will be sketched.
<br>
This is the first index theorem for Dirac operators on *Lorentzian*
manifolds and, from an analytic perspective, the methods to obtain it
are quite different from the classical Riemannian case. This is joint
work with Alexander Strohmaier.
