<em> Decompositions of log-correlated fields with applications </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
We consider a simple idea to decompose of log-correlated Gaussian fields into two-parts, both of which behave well in suitable sense. Applications include Onsager type inequalities in all dimensions, analytic dependence and  existence of critical chaos measures for a large class of log-correlated fields. Talk is based on Joint work with Janne Junnila (EPFL) and Christian Webb (Aalto University).
