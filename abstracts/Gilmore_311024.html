<em> 
Universality of composition operators and applications to complex dynamics
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

We consider universality properties of composition operators C<sub>f</sub> : g
&mapsto; g &cir; f, acting on spaces of holomorphic functions, where the symbol
f is given by a transcendental entire function restricted to parts of its Fatou
set F(f). The investigation of this topic was initiated by Jung [J. Anal. Math.,
2019], and it lies at the interface of complex dynamics and operator theory.   
<br> <br>
We will discuss new results on the universality of C<sub>f</sub> when the symbol f is
restricted to certain Baker and wandering domains. In the case where such
universal functions exist, we will describe their local behaviour near points of
f that have specific dynamical properties. We will also consider the more
general class of weighted composition operators in this context, where we
uncover analogous universality results for this larger class.
