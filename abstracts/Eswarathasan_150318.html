    <p><strong> Suresh Eswarathasan </strong> (Cardiff) <br /> <br /> <em>  $L^p$ restriction of eigenfunctions to random Cantor-type sets

</em><br /> <br />
Abstract: <br>
Let $(M,g)$ be a compact Riemannian surface without boundary.  Consider the corresponding $L^2$-normalized Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions.  Eigenfunctions of this type arise in physics as modes of periodic vibration of drums and membranes. They also represent stationary states of a free quantum particle on a Riemannian manifold.  In the first part of the lecture, I will give a survey of results which demonstrate how the geometry of $M$ affects the behaviour of these special functions, particularly their 'size' which can be quantified by estimating $L^p$ norms.<br>
<br>
    In joint work with Malabika Pramanik (U. British Columbia), I will present in the second part of my lecture a result on the $L^p$ restriction of these eigenfunctions to random Cantor-type subsets of $M$.  This, in some sense, is complementary to the smooth submanifold $L^p$ restriction results of Burq-Gerard-Tzetkov '06 (and later work of other authors).  Our method includes concentration inequalities from probability theory in addition to the analysis of singular Fourier integral operators on fractals.
