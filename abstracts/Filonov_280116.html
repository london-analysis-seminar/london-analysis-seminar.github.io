<em>  On the structure of the edges of spectral bands of the periodic Schroedinger operator
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
We consider the multi-dimensional Schroedinger operator with a bounded 
periodic potential. 
We show that in the 2D case the corresponding band functions
can attain their extrema only at a finite number of points.
This is a joint work with I.Kachkovskiy.
