<em>On positive solutions of semi-linear elliptic inequalities on Riemannian manifolds</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
We are concerned with two problems about semi-linear elliptic inequalities:<br>
- existence of entire positive solutions;<br>
- pointwise estimates of such solutions.<br>
The answers are given in terms of the volume function and Green function.
