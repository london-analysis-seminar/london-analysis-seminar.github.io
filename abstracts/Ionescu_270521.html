<em>On the global regularity for the Einstein-Klein-Gordon coupled
system </em><br />
<br />
Abstract: In joint work with Benoit Pausader we consider the Einstein
field equations of General Relativity for self-gravitating massive scalar
fields (the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system). Our main results concern the
global regularity, modified scattering, and precise asymptotic analysis of
solutions of this system with initial data in a small neighborhood of the
Minkowski space-time.
