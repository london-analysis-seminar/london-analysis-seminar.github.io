<em> Scaling laws in turbulent convection </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

 Scaling laws are a useful tool in studying and characterizing geo-physical
 flows as they may indicate their behaviour in extreme parameter regimes which
 are unapproachable by experiments. In particular, the challenge of finding
 scaling laws requires synergetic efforts involving laboratory, computational,
 and theoretical studies. In fact, deducing and calibrating scaling laws
 requires physical arguments, analytical bounding arguments, numerical
 simulations and experiments. We will focus on convection problems as they are a
 relevant in a multitude of natural phenomena in meteorology, oceanography and
 industrial applications. In this seminar we are interested in rigorously
 proving power law scalings for the heat transport, as measured by the
 nondimensional Nusselt number Nu for the Rayleigh-B&eacute;nard convection problem.
 In this specific case the scaling laws have the functional form Nu &sim;
 Ra<sup>&alpha;</sup>, where Ra is the thermal driving of the system. We will present
 the latest rigorous upper bounds on the Nusselt number for flows subject to
 various boundary conditions (no-slip, free-slip and Navier-slip) in flat and
 rough domains. In particular we will show how to substantially simplify
 arguments used in the seminal works of Doering and Constantin in the 90's and
 improve bounds.
