The Szeg&#246 equation and inverse spectral problems for Hankel operators
</I>

Abstract: 
<br>

We consider the cubic Szeg&#246 equation: i u_t = Pi (|u|^2u) on the real line, 
where Pi is the Szeg&#246 projector 
on non-negative frequencies.  
This equation was recently introduced as a model of a non-dispersive non-linear 
PDE by P. Gerard (Paris-Sud University, Orsay, France) and 
S. Grellier (University of Orleans, France).  
Like 1-d cubic NLS and KdV, it is known to be completely integrable 
in the sense that it possesses a Lax pair structure. 
The operator L in the Lax pair is a Hankel operator.

In this talk we discuss the explicit formula for the solutions of the Szeg&#246 equation.  
We also present  the construction of generalized action-angle coordinates for the 
Szeg&#246 equation restricted to finite dimensional manifolds of rational functions. 
As an application, we solve the inverse spectral problem for Hankel operators of finite rank 
(whose symbols are rational functions). If times allows, we present two other applications: 
the soliton resolution of certain solutions and an example of solution whose high Sobolev 
norms grow to infinity over time.
