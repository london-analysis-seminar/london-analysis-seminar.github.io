<em> Thomas-Fermi type models of external charge screening in graphene </em><br />
<br />
Abstract:<br> 
Graphene is a recently discovered material which consists of exactly one
atomic layer of carbon. We discuss density functional theories of
Thomas-Fermi and Thomas-Fermi-von Weizsacker type which describe the
response of a single layer of graphene to an external electric charge.
Mathematically, this amounts to the analysis of two nonlocal variational
problems which involve Coulombic terms and a Hardy type potential. We
formulate variational setting in which the proposed energy functionals
admit minimizers. The associated Euler-Lagrange equations are also
obtained, and uniqueness and regularity of the minimizers are proved
under some conditions. In addition, we discuss the decay rate
(screening) of the minimizers and describe several open problems.<br>
