Eugene Shargorodsky (King's College London): 
<br><br>

Title: The Amick-Fraenkel conjecture.



<br><br>

Abstract: <br>

<br>

In 1987, C.J. Amick and L.E. Fraenkel published a paper on the behaviour
of the Stokes wave of extreme form near its crest, where they obtained a
complete
asymptotic expansion for the angle between the wave profile and the
horizontal.
Their derivation of the expansion included an assumption about a
question in number theory. This question is still open and the partial
answers obtained by
Amick and Fraenkel seem to be the only known results in this direction.
The aim
of the talk is to show how the Amick-Fraenkel conjecture is related to
some other results and conjectures in transcendental number theory.
