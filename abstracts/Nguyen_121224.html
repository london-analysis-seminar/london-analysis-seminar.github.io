<em> 
    The &Phi;<sup>4</sup><sub>3</sub> measure on Riemannian manifolds
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

I will describe a joint work with Bailleul, Ferdinand and To where we construct
the &Phi;<sup>4</sup><sub>3</sub> quantum field theory measure on compact Riemannian 3-manifolds, as
invariant measure of some stochastic partial differential equation, I will try
to motivate the approach and show many examples. This gives an example of
nonperturbative, interacting, non topological quantum field theory constructed
on 3 manifolds.
