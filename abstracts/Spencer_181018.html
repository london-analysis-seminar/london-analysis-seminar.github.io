<em>  Edge reinforced random walk as a toy model of localization </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
I will present some results and conjectures about edge 
reinforced random walk (ERRW). This is a history dependent walk which 
favors edges it has visited in the past. In three dimensions the walk 
has a phase transition as the reinforcement is varied. The  relation of 
ERRW to a toy model of quantum localization will also be discussed.
