<em>  Minimal surfaces and eigenvalue problems
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
I will tell about eigenvalue problems for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on Riemannian manifolds, and will describe a number of relationships between them and the minimal surface theory. 
In particular, I will discuss a few conjectures and open questions in the area, and a number of related results. If time permits, I will also tell about extremal eigenvalue problems.
