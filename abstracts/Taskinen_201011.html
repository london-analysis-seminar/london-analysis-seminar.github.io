Abstract:

 The linear elasticity problem is an elliptic system of PDE's in a given
domain, associated with Neumann-type boundary conditions. We consider
 some domains with nontrivial geometries, which lead to interesting spectral
 structure of the problem. One example concerns a bounded body with cuspidal,
 beak-like shape. We characterize the discreteness of the spectrum in terms
 of the sharpness of the beak. In particular, given a sharp enough shape,
 the essential (and continuous) spectra are not empty. Another case deals
 with an unbounded periodic waveguide. We construct examples which have
 band-gap like essential spectrum and sketch a method using which one can
 prove the existence of any given number of  spectral gaps.  This reports
 on joint work with Sergey Nazarov and others.
