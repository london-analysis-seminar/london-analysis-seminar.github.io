Spectral deviation of localisation operators and applications
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

This talk focuses on the eigenvalue distribution of localisation operators of
the form $P\chi_\Omega P$, where $P$ is the orthogonal projection onto a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space and $\Omega$ is a compact domain. We estimate
how much the corresponding eigenvalue counting function deviates from the
measure of the localisation domain. Our results are quantitative both in terms
of the size of the domain and the spectral threshold of the eigenvalue counting
function. We discuss applications to signal processing and mathematical physics
enabled by this two-parameter control.
