<em> Geometric measure theory in metric spaces</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
This talk will give an overview of recent work that generalises results
of classical geometric measure theory to arbitrary metric spaces. We
will begin with a brief history of analysis on metric spaces, its
relationship with differential geometry and the foundational work of
Kirchheim on rectifiable subsets of an arbitrary metric space. I will
then present new results related to the Besicovitch--Federer projection
theorem and the Marstrand--Mattila characterisation of rectifiable sets
in terms of tangent spaces. The talk will be self contained and no
specialist prior knowledge is required.
