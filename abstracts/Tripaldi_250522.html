Possible div-curl estimates on the 5-dimensional Cartan group
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

On arbitrary Carnot groups, the only hypoelliptic Hodge-Laplacians on forms that
have been introduced are 0-order pseudodifferential operators constructed using
the Rumin complex. However, to address questions where one needs sharp
estimates, this 0-order operator is not suitable. Indeed, this is a rather
difficult problem to tackle in full generality, the main issue being that the
Rumin exterior differential is not homogeneous on arbitrary Carnot groups. In
this talk, I will focus on the specific example of the free Carnot group of step
3 with 2 generators, where it is possible to introduce different hypoelliptic
Hodge-Laplacians on forms. Such Laplacians can be used to obtain sharp div-curl
type inequalities akin to those considered by Bourgain &amp; Brezis and Lanzani
&amp;
Stein for the de Rham complex, or their subelliptic counterparts obtained by
Baldi, Franchi &amp; Pansu for the Rumin complex on Heisenberg groups.
