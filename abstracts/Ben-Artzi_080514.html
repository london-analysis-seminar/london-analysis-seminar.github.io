<em>From  crystal optics to Dirac operators: a spectral theory of first-order systems</em><br>
<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Abstract:</span> First-order systems of partial differential equations appear in many areas of physics, from the Maxwell equations to the Dirac operator. The aim of the talk is to describe a general method for the study of the spectral density of all such systems, connecting it to traces on the (geometric-optical)&nbsp; "slowness surfaces". The Holder continuity of the spectral density leads to a derivation of the limiting absorption principle and global spacetime estimates. (Based on joint work with Tomio Umeda).
