Title: From dynamics to spectral theory on complete negatively curved
manifolds.

<br><br>

Abstract: <br>

The main focus of this talk is joint work with P.
Suarez-Serrato and S. Tapie concerning the dynamical theory of convex
cocompact manifolds.  These manifolds contain many interesting examples:
convex cocompact hyperbolic manifolds, asymptotically hyperbolic
manifolds (with variable negative curvature), and the conformally
compact manifolds (with variable negative curvature) introduced by
Fefferman and Graham in the 1980s to study conformal invariants and more
recently studied in mathematical physics based on their role in AdS-CFT
correspondence in string theory.  We first show that generalized
dynamical zeta functions on these manifolds admit a non-vanishing
analytic extension (with the exception of one simple pole) to a certain
half space.  These results imply counting theorems, known as ``prime
orbit theorems,'' for the number of closed geodesics.  Finally, I will
discuss my work in the case of strongly- asymptotically-hyperbolic
manifolds, and interactions between the dynamics and spectral theory of
these spaces.  Physically, such interactions imply relationships between
their quantum and classical mechanics.
