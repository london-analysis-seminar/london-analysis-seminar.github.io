<em> An end-point result for bilinear Fourier integral operators </em><br />
<br />
Abstract: I will describe an extension of a theorem of R. Coifman and
Y. Meyer regarding bilinear pseudo-differential operators to bilinear
Fourier integral operators. More precisely, we prove the global $L^2
\times L^2 \to L^1$ boundedness of bilinear Fourier integral operators
with amplitudes in the class $S^0_{1,0}$. The proof makes use of a
quadratic $T(1)$-theorem and commutator estimates. This is joint work
with Wolfgang Staubach and Salvador Rodriguez-Lopez.
