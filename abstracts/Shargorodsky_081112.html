<em> Negative eigenvalues of two-dimensional Schroedinger operators </em><br />
<br />
Abstract: I will discuss estimates for the number of negative eigenvalues of a
two-dimensional
Schroedinger operator in terms of "L log L" type Orlicz norms of the
potential. The obtained results prove a
conjecture by N.N. Khuri, A. Martin and T.T. Wu (2002).
