On ODE blow up for the focusing nonlinear wave equation
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

In any spacetime dimension, the equation &#9744; &Phi; = - &Phi;<sup>p</sup> "ODE
blow-up" solutions of the form &Phi; = c (T - t)<sup>-&alpha;</sup>, where &Phi; blows up
on the hypersurface {t = T}. In this talk, we discuss how one can prescribe
generalized ODE blow-up solutions that blow up on any suitably regular spacelike
hypersurface in Minkowski space, as well as the stability properties of this
blow up curve to perturbations away from the singularity. This talk is based on
upcoming joint work with Istvan Kadar (ETH Zurich).
