<em> Homological connecticity in random &#268;ech complexes and poisson
    approximation </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

A well-known phenomenon in random graphs is the phase-transition for
connectivity, proved first by Erd&#337;s&ndash;R&eacute;nyi in 1959. In this talk we will discuss
a high-dimensional analogue of this phenomenon known as "homological
connectivity". Briefly, homology is an algebraic-topological structure
describing various types of "cycles" that can be formed in high-dimensional
shapes. Considering an increasing sequence of shapes, homological cycles are
formed and filled in at various times. Homological connectivity is the point
where the homology of such sequences stops changing, or "stabilizes". The model
we study is the random &#268;ech complex, which is a high-dimensional generalisation
of the random geometric graph.

We will show that there is a sequence of sharp phase transitions (for different degrees of homology).

In addition, we will show that in each critical window, the obstructions to homological connectivity have a functional Poisson process limit.
