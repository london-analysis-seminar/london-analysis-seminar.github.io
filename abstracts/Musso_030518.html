<em>  Singularity formation in critical parabolic equations </em><br />
<br />
Abstract: <br>
In this talk I will discuss some recent constructions of blow-up solutions for a Fujita type problem for power 
related to the critical Sobolev exponent. Both finite type blow-up (of type II) and
infinite time blow-up are considered. This research program is in collaboration with C. Cortazar,
M. del Pino and J. Wei.
