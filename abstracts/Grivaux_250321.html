<em>Baire category methods and the Invariant Subspace Problem</em><br>

Abstract: <br>
Given a separable Banach space $X$ of infinite dimension, one can consider
on the space $\mathcal{B}(X)$ of bounded linear operators on $X$ several
natural topologies which turn the closed unit ball
$B_1(X)=\{T\in\mathcal{B}(X);||T||\le 1\}$ into a Polish space, i.e. a
separable and completely metrizable space.

In these talk, I will present some results concerning typical properties
in the Baire Category sense of operators of $B_1(X)$ for these
topologies when $X$ is a $\ell_p$-space. Our main motivation for this
study is linked to the Invariant Subspace Problem, which asks for the
existence of non-trivial invariant closed subspaces for bounded operators
on Banach spaces. It is thus interesting to try to determine whether
typical contractions on $\ell_p$-spaces have a non-trivial invariant
subspace or not.

The talk is based on joint work with Etienne Matheron and Quentin Menet.
