<em>Hot spot conjectures for some domains in the plane  </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

I shall talk about the hot spots conjecture for domains in the plane. I will try
to give a brief review of the existing literature. I will explain some of my
works on this conjecture, done in collaboration with Chris Judge. If time
permits, I will try to explain the main challenges that our approach leads to.
