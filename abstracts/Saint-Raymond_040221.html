<em> Fluctuation theory in the Boltzmann-Grad limit </em><br />
<br />
Abstract: <br>
In this talk, I will discuss a long term project with T. Bodineau, I. Gallagher and S. Simonella on hard-sphere dynamics in the kinetic regime, away from thermal equilibrium. 
In the low density limit, the empirical density obeys a law of large numbers and the dynamics is governed by the Boltzmann equation. 
Deviations from this behavior are described by dynamical correlations, which can be fully characterized for short times. 
This provides both a fluctuating Boltzmann equation and large deviation asymptotics.
