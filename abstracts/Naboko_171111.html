On the spectral analysis of unbounded Jacobi operators with a 
few gaps in the essential spectrum
</I>

Abstract: 
<br>

Two methods for construction of examples of unbounded selfadjoint Jacobi
operators with a few gaps (bounded and unbounded) in the essential
spectra  to be discussed. The relation of the second one to the Last-Simon
approach for the essential spectra calculation is one of the talk goals.
