<em>Transition from homogenization to averaging in cellular flows </em><br>
<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Abstract:</span> We consider an elliptic problem that involves two parameters (the size of the domain, which may be<br>large, and the magnitude of the diffusion coefficient, which may be small). Depending on the relation between the<br>parameters, the asymptotics of the solution is given either by homogenization theory or by averaging.<br>Using probabilistic techniques, we give a precise description of the transition regime, where a more intricate<br>behavior is observed.&nbsp;
