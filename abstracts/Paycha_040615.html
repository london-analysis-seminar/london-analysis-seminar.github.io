<em>  The Wodzicki residue; a useful analytic tool for geometric purposes </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: 
The Wodzicki residue is a useful analytic tool to capture geometric
information. Using the inverse Mellin transform, one can express the
singular part as well as the constant term of  the heat-kernel expansion
on a closed manifold in terms of Wodzicki residues. This extends to
two rather different geometric frameworks;   the   noncommutative torus
on the one hand and   Hilbert modules on the other.   We     revisit
Atiyah's L^2-index theorem  by means of the (extended) Wodzicki residue
and inspired by Connes et al.,  define  scalar curvature on the
noncommutative two torus as an (extended) Wodzicki  residue.
Based on joint work with Sara Azzali, Cyril Lévy and Carolina
Neira-Jimenez.
