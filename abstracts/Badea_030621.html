<em>  Analytic properties of sets of integers</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>

The talk is intended to be a non-technical survey of sets of integers determined by operator-theoretical, harmonic analysis, or ergodic theory properties. A special attention will be devoted to the sequence of integers of the form $2^m3^n$, which is related to Furstenberg's times 2, times 3 conjecture.
