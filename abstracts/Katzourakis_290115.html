<em>  Generalised solutions for fully nonlinear PDE systems and Vectorial Calculus of Variations in $L^\infty$ </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: 
Calculus of Variations in $L^\infty$ has a long history, initiated by Aronsson in the 1960s and is under active research ever since. Mathematically, minimising the supremum is very challenging (the equations are non-divergence and highly degenerate systems) but it provides more realistic models, as opposed to the classical case of the average (integral). However, due to fundamental difficulties, until the early 2010s the field was restricted to the scalar case. In this talk I will discuss the vectorial case, which has recently been initiated by the speaker. The analysis of the $L^\infty$-equations is based on a recently proposed general duality-free PDE theory of generalised solutions for fully nonlinear systems.
