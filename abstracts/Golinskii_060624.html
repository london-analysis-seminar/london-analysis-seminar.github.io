Abstract: <br><br>

We study the quantitative structure of the discrete spectrum for
non-self-adjoint (NSA) Schr&ouml;dinger operators on the half-line with the Dirichlet
boundary condition and NSA semi-infinite Jacobi operators. We prove upper and
lower bounds for sums of eigenvalues of the Lieb&ndash;Thirring type for such
operators. The upper bounds are established for general classes of complex,
integrable potentials and are shown to be optimal in various senses by proving
the lower bounds for specific potentials.
