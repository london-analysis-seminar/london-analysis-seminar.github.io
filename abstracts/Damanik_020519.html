<em> The F&uuml;rstenberg-Ishii Criterion for a Positive Lyapunov Exponent and Applications to Anderson Localization </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
We discuss a criterion for random products of SL(2,R) matrices to have a positive Lyapunov exponent that is inspired by work of Ishii and that provides a sufficient condition for an application of the well-known F&uuml;rstenberg theorem. Applications of this criterion include localization results for the continuum 1D Anderson model, random operators on random radial trees, and Schr&ouml;dinger operators with general random local point interactions.
