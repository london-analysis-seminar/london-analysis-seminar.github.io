<em>  Quantum transport in a low-density periodic potential
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
Erdos and Eng proved that the linear Boltzmann equation describes the
Boltzmann-Grad limit of the quantum dynamics in a low-density random
potential. We will discuss the same limit for a periodic potential,
and show that up to second order in the coupling constant the result
agrees with the linear Boltzmann equation. We conjecture, however,
that higher-order terms do not agree with the linear Boltzmann
equation. This is joint work with Jory Griffin.
