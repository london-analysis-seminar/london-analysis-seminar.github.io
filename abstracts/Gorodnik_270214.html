<em>  Quantitative density of orbits </em><br />
<br />
Abstract: 
We consider the situation when orbits of a group action
fill the space densely and address the question of how dense
the orbits actually are. This leads to a notion of approximation exponents.
In a joint work with Ghosh and Nevo we establish upper and lower
bounds on these exponents which  are optimal in a number of cases.
