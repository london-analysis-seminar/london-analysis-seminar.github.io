Title: Long time behavior for vortex dynamics in the 2 dimensional Euler
equations<br><br>


Abstract: The evolution of a two dimensional incompressible ideal fluid with smooth initial
 vorticity concentrated in small regions is well understood on finite intervals of time: it
 converges to a super position of Dirac deltas centered at collision-less solutions to the
 point vortex system, in the limit of vanishing regions. Even though  for generic initial
 conditions the vortex point system has a global smooth solution, much less is known on the
 long time behavior of the fluid vorticity.

 We consider the case of two vortex pairs traveling in opposite directions. Using gluing
 methods we describe the global dynamics of this configuration. This work is in
 collaboration with J Davila (U. of Bath), M. del Pino (U of Bath) and S. Parmeshwar
 (Warwick University).
