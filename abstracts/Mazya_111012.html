Abstract: We discuss sharp continuity and regularity results for solutions of the
 polyharmonic equation in an arbitrary open set. The absence of
 information about  geometry of the domain puts the question of
 regularity properties  beyond the scope of applicability of the methods
 devised previously, which typically rely on specific geometric assumptions.
 Positive results have been available only when the domain is
 sufficiently smooth, Lipschitz or diffeomorphic to a polyhedron.
The techniques developed recently  allow  to establish the
 boundedness of derivatives of solutions to the Dirichlet problem for the
 polyharmonic equation  under no restrictions on the underlying domain
 and to show that the order of the derivatives is maximal. An appropriate
 notion of polyharmonic capacity  is introduced which
 allows one to describe the precise correlation between the smoothness of
 solutions and the geometry of the domain.
