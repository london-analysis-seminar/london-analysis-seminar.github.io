<em>  From Anderson localization to entanglement bounds </em><br>
<br>

   Abstract: Anderson introduced his model in 1958 in an attempt to understand transport in disordered quantum systems. He greatly simplified the physics by essentially ignoring interaction terms in many-body systems. Only much more recently have the possible effects of interactions on disordered systems and the related concept of many-body localization received increased attention in condensed matter physics and quantum information theory. Here many questions remain wide open, in particular on the side of rigorous work. We will use the simple model of the XY spin chain in random field to illustrate the differences between one-body and many-body localization and to present a few rigorous results.
