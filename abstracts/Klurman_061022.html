<em>On the random Chowla conjecture</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

A celebrated conjecture of Chowla in number theory asserts that for the
Liouville function &lambda;(n) and any non-square polynomial
P(x)&isin;&#x2124;[x] one expects cancellations &sum;<sub>n&le;x</sub>
    &lambda;(P(n))=o(x). In the case P(n)=n, this corresponds to the prime
number theorem, but the conjecture is widely open for any polynomial of degree
deg(P) &ge; 2. In 1944, Wintner proposed to study random model for this question (in
the case P(n)=n) where &lambda;(n) is replaced by a random multiplicative
function f(n). Since then, this problem attracted a lot of attention in
probability, number theory and analytic communities. 
 The aim of the talk is to discuss recent advances in understanding the
 distribution and the size of the largest fluctuations of appropriately
 normalized partial sums &sum;<sub>n&le;x</sub> f(n)$ (mostly due to Harper) and my
 recent joint work with I. Shkredov and M. W. Xu aiming to understand
 &sum;<sub>n&le;x</sub> f(P(n)) for any polynomial of deg(P)&ge; 2.
