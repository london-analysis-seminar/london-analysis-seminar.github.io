<em>  The free boundary problem for a slightly compressible liquid
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>

We prove a new type of energy estimates for the 
compressible Euler's equation with free boundary, with a boundary part and 
an interior part. These can be thought of as a generalization of the 
energies in Christodoulou and Lindblad [CL] to the compressible case 
and do not require the fluid to be irrotational. In addition, we show that 
our estimates are in fact uniform in the sound speed. As a 
consequence, we obtain convergence of solutions of compressible Euler 
equations with a free boundary to solutions of the incompressible 
equations,
   generalizing the result of Ebin [Eb] to when you have a free 
boundary. In the incompressible case our energies reduces to those in 
[CL] and our proof in particular gives a simplified proof of the 
estimates in [CL] with improved error estimates. Since for an 
incompressible irrotational liquid with free surface there are small data 
global existence results our result  leaves open the possibility of long 
time existence also for slightly compressible liquids
   with a free surface. This is joint work with Chenyun Luo.
