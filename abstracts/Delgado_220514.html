<em>  Spectral properties on compact groups </em><br />
<br />
Abstract: 
Given a compact topological group G, in this talk we first present a characterisation of 
Schatten ideals of operators on L^2(G) and some applications to the analysis of 
differential operators when G is a compact Lie group. 
In the second part we consider nuclear (Grothendieck) operators on L^p(G) spaces 
and establish sufficient conditions for the membership to those ideals. 
We also relate our results with the Grothendieck-Lidskii trace formula.
