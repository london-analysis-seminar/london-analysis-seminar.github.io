<em>  Transition asymptotics for Toeplitz and Fredholm determinants 
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
We will discuss recent results on the asymptotic behaviour of certain
Toeplitz and Fredholm determinants appearing in the theory of random matrices
and related areas focusing on the situation where a transition between 2 different
asymptotic regimes takes place. The talk is based on joint works with
Th. Bothner, T. Claeys, P. Deift, and A. Its.
