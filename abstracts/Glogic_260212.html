Title: Discretely self-similar blowup for a geometric wave equation

<br><br>

Abstract: <br>

Self-similar solutions often play an important role in the blowup dy- namics of nonlinear evolution equations. These solutions come in two types: (1) continuously self-similar (CSS), which have been the focus of extensive rigor- ous analysis over the past several decades, and (2) discretely self-similar (DSS), which, despite playing a significant role in numerical and heuristic studies in hy- perbolic contexts, remain far less understood from a rigorous perspective.
To initiate a rigorous stability analysis of DSS phenomena in hyperbolic contexts, in this talk we propose a toy model consisting of a semilinear wave equation for maps from the Minkowski space R1+d into the circle S1, featuring a null-form nonlinearity. For every d ≥ 1, we construct a countable family of DSS blowup so- lutions and show that they are finite co-dimensionally stable, with the precise co- dimension determined by the explicitly computed unstable spectrum. The proof relies, in particular, on delicate resolvent estimates yielding the required control of the linearized flow. To our knowledge, this is the first result on the existence and stability of DSS blowup for a nonlinear wave equation. This is joint work with David Hilditch (Lisbon) and David Wallauch (EPFL).
