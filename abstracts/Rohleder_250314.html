From the hot spots conjecture to Neumann&ndash;Dirichlet eigenvalue comparison
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

Motivated by the famous hot spots conjecture, in this talk we discover a
non-standard variational approach to the eigenvalues (and eigenfunctions) of the
Neumann and Dirichlet Laplacian operators on bounded planar domains. A variant
of this variational principle turns out to yield an inequality between Neumann
and Dirichlet Laplacian eigenvalues on simply connected planar domains which
previously only had been known for convex domains.
