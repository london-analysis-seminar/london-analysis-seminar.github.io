<em>  The half-wave maps equation and Hankel operators
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
I will introduce an energy critical 
quasilinear hyperbolic evolution system on maps from the line
into the two-dimensional sphere.
I will show that this system admits a Lax pair involving
Hankel operators with some matrix symbols, and I will stress
some  consequences of this result for the  corresponding dynamics.<br>
This is a joint work with Enno Lenzmann (Basel).
