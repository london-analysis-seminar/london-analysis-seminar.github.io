<em> Invariance and unimodularity  </em><br />

Abstract: Dealing with random graphs inevitably leads to a study of invariance
properties of the associated measures on the space of rooted graphs.
In this context there are two natural notions: that of measures invariant
with respect to the "root moving" equivalence relation (based on ideas
from ergodic theory and geometry of foliations) and that of unimodular
measures recently introduced by probabilists. I will give a brief
survey of the area, and, in particular, clarify the relationship between
these two classes of measures.
