Abstract: 
<br>

Fine structure of harmonic measure plays an important role in
the classical geometric function theory. In particular, many
long-standing problems can be formulated in terms of multifractal
analysis  of harmonic measure. In this talk I will give a survey of the
topic and discuss some new results.
