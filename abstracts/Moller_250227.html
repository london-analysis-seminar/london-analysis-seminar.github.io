<em>
(Non)uniqueness of tangent planes and removable singularities at infinite time for the translating solitons equation
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

Translating solitons for mean curvature flow are, in certain collapsed cases,
known to subconverge locally to "tangent planes at infinity", as time t &rarr;
&plusmn;&infin;.
This raises the natural question whether L<sup>&infin;</sup> solutions to the quasilinear
equation with a drift term may at large scales "wobble" off towards infinity, or
if there hold removable singularities theorems at infinite times?

<br><br>

The question turns out to yield a delicate "yes and no": Yes, as we will in this
talk prove, for complete solitons, such tangent planes are indeed uniquely
defined (with geometric consequences in the classification program). No, as we
construct solitons complete with boundary which, despite decay of all
derivatives, admit a continuum of vertical planes as subsequential limits.
