\noindent Abstract:

\ %

\noindent We study conditions on functions $f$ of two variables, under which the
fact that $N_1$ and $N_2$ are normal operators and the operator
$N_1-N_2$ is small implies that the operator 
$f(N_1)-f(N_2)$. Is small. By "small", we can mean different things:
the norm is small, the operator belongs to a certain operator ideal,
the ideal norm is small. 

In particular, we study operator Lipschitz functions, i.e., functions
$f$ such that 
$$
  \|f(N_1)-f(N_2)\|\le{\rm const}\|N_1-N_2\|
$$
and operator H\"older functions of order $\alpha$, $0<\alpha<1$. We
also study the case when 
$N_1-N_2$ belongs to Schatten--von Neumann ideals.
