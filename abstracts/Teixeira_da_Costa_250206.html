The Maxwell equations on the full Kerr black hole family
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

Abstract: We discuss a proof of uniform boundedness and decay statements for
solutions to the Maxwell equations on Kerr black holes. The proof is
unconditional in the full subextremal |a|&#60;M family, in view of earlier joint
work with Yakov Shlapentokh-Rothman. For extremal |a|=M Kerr, it is conditional
on a conjecture for the spin &plusmn;1 Teukolsky equations motivated by work of Gajic
and Casals&ndash;Gralla&ndash;Zimmerman. This is joint work with Gabriele Benomio (GSSI).
