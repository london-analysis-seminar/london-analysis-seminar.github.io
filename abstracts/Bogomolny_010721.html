<em> Spectral statistics of low-complexity matrices </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: 
It is demonstrated that spectral statistics of random Toeplitz, Hankel, and Toeplitz-plus-Hakel matrices are of intermediate type typical for pseudo-integrable billiards.  Wigner-type approximate formulas  are obtained for these matrices in a good argreement with numerical calculations. It is observed that eigenfunctions for such matrices are multi-fractals in the Fourier space.
