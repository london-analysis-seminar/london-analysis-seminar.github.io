<em>  Self-similar solutions of the one-dimensional 
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>
We consider the one-dimensional Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, 
a model describing the dynamics for the spin in ferromagnetic materials. 
Our main aim is the construction of a bi-parametric family 
of self-similar solutions for this model and the analytical study 
of these solutions with respect to the so-called Gilbert damping parameter.
