<em>  Differentiability of Lipschitz functions inside null sets </em><br />
<br />
Abstract: Given a space X, we are looking for its subset S as small as
possible with the universal differentiability property, i.e. that
every Lipschitz function on X has a point of differentiability in S.
We show that every finite dimensional space contains universal
differentiability sets of upper Minkowski dimension 1.
