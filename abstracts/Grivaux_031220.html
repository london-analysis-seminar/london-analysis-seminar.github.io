<em>Typical properties of contractions on l_p-spaces</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
Given a separable Banach space $X$ of infinite dimension, one can consider
on the space $\mathcal{B}(X)$ of bounded linear operators on $X$ several
natural topologies which turn the closed unit ball
$B_1(X)=\{T\in\mathcal{B}(X);||T||\le 1\}$ into a Polish space, i.e. a
separable and completely metrizable space.

In this talk, I will present some results concerning typical properties
in the Baire Category sense of operators of $B_1(X)$ for these
topologies when $X$ is a $\ell_p$-space, our main interest being to
determine whether typical contractions on these spaces have a non-trivial
invariant subspace or not.
