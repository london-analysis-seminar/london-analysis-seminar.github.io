<em> Coercive Inequalities and U-Bounds </em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

In the setting of step-two Carnot groups, we prove Poincar&eacute; and
&#946;-Logarithmic Sobolev inequalities for probability measures as a function
of various homogeneous norms. To do that, the key idea is to obtain an
intermediate inequality called the U-Bound inequality (based on joint work with
B. Zegarlinski). Using this U-Bound inequality, we show that certain infinite
dimensional Gibbs measures &mdash; with unbounded interaction potentials as a function
of homogeneous norms &mdash; on an infinite product of Carnot groups satisfy the
Poincar&eacute; inequality (based on joint work with Y. Qiu, B. Zegarlinski, and M.
Zhang).
<br>
We also enlarge the class of measures as a function of the Carnot-Carath&eacute;odory
distance that gives us the q&ndash;Logarithmic Sobolev inequality in the setting of
Carnot groups. As an application, we use the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in that
setting to prove the p&ndash;Talagrand inequality and hypercontractivity.
