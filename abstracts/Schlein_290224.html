Title:Bogoliubov theory for dilute quantum systems 
<br><br>


Abstract: In this talk, I am going to present a recently developed,
mathematically rigorous version of Bogoliubov theory and I am going to explain
how it can be used to describe correlations in many-body quantum systems and to
determine the low-energy spectrum of dilute Bose gases.
