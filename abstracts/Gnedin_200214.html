<em>  The arrangement problem for Poisson-Dirichlet random measures and partitions </em><br />
<br />
Abstract: 
A stick-breaking construction of the (two-parameter) Poisson-Dirichlet 
random measure  yields the masses arranged in the size-biased order.  
Another order, which may be called `regenerative',  
appears when the masses are associated with jumps of a transformed  
increasing Levy process.  
For Ewens' subfamily these orders coincide, but in general 
the relation is more delicate. 
In this talk we show how the orders can be constructively linked to one another 
by means of a parametric family 
of  infinite random permutations. 
A similar problem is also discussed in terms of integer partitions 
induced by drawing a finite sample from the Poisson-Dirichlet distribution.
