<em>Wave decay on asymptotically flat spacetimes</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
The focus of this talk is the study of asymptotic expansions of linear waves propagating on stationary and asymptotically flat spacetimes. On the spectral side, I will describe a hands-on approach to resolvent expansions near zero energy based on recent work by Vasy. I will discuss two main applications: first, sharp decay for scattering by short range potentials on R^3; second, a strengthening of Price's Law on Kerr spacetimes.<br><br>
