<em>  An inverse spectral problem for pairs of Hankel operators on the circle
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
I will review recent results allowing to describe the symbol of a compact Hankel operator
on the circle in terms of the singular values of this operator and of the associated shifted operator.
I will also present more recent partial generalizations to the case of non compact Hankel operators.
Finally I will explain how this problem is connected to some integrable Hamiltonian dynamics on the Hardy
space. This talk is from joint works with Sandrine Grellier and Alexander Pushnitski.
