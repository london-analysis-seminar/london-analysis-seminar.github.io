Markoff triples and their connection to orbits of the mapping class group
</em><br>
<br>
Abstract: <br><br>

The Markoff triples are the natural solutions of the Markoff relation
x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>+z<sup>2</sup>=3xyz. They can be viewed as points in the orbit of the mapping
class group acting on the character variety of the punctured torus. In this case
the action is transitive. However, when considering surfaces with a higher genus
or number of holes, this is no longer the case. We will discuss the possible
orbits closures of the general case; the algebraic relations that are preserved
under the action and the exceptional cases. This is a joint work with Alireza
Salehi-Golsefidy.
