<em> On some sharp spectral inequalities for Schroedinger operators on semiaxis </em><br />
<br />
Abstract:
We obtain sharp Lieb-Thirring inequalities for a Schroedinger operator on semiaxis with a matrix potential and show how they can be used to other related problems. Among them are spectral inequalities on star graphs  and spectral inequalities for Schroedinger operators on half-spaces with Robin boundary conditions.
