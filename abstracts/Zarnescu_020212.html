Abstract:  We consider domains whose  boundary can be locally represented as the graph of a continuous  function and construct smooth approximations that preserve topological  properties  (in particular the fundamental group, for instance). The main tool for doing this is a notion of (multivalued) map of &quot;good  directions at a point&quot;, that is a map that associates to a point in the   neighbourhood of the boundary the directions along which the boundary  can be locally represented as the graph of a continuous function. We study various properties of the map of good directions and also use  it to show that there must be points on the the boundary of the domain,  in a neighbourhood of which the domain is  in fact smoother, it is  locally Lipschitz. This is joint work with John M. Ball.
